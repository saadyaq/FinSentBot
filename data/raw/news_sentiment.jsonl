European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are traveling with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0to Washington to meet Trump at the White House to discuss a peace deal.Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the president could \"end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.\"The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire.

Global markets were on tenterhooks Monday as momentum to end the war in Ukraine appeared to be ramping up, with European leaders heading to Washington for more talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.European markets traded mixedahead of the summit later today at the White House, which followsTrump's high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putinin Alaska on Friday, whileU.S. stock futures had moved lower.Meanwhile,Asia-Pacific indicesovernight traded mostly higher in anticipation of the talks.Traders will be hoping that an end to the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a conflict which began in 2022 and which has shaken the global economy, disrupting trade and supply chains, and creating geopolitical chasms between major economies in the West and East \u2014 could be nearer now than at any other time.But those in the know say fledgling talks between stakeholders Russia, Ukraine, Europe and the U.S. are just the beginning of what could be a long and thorny path to a ceasefire \u2014 as Trump's inconclusive talks with Putin on Friday proved \u2014 let alone peace.That would be in stark contrast to Trump's well-documented love of a quick deal, and should be a wake-up call for global market optimism, experts say.\"Peace agreements take a very, very long time to achieve,\" James Bindenagel, visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, told CNBC Monday. \"And what Putin has said is that he wants peace talks so he can continue the war, knowing that it won't come to a peace agreement for a very long time. That is simply not acceptable,\" he said.\"You cannot negotiate on a peace agreement for five years, ten years, and let the Russians continue their war against the Ukrainians.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO chief Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are among the European leaders traveling to Washington for talks on Monday.They're accompanying Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0to discuss Ukraine's future and possible conditions for a peace deal, including land swaps (reportedly proposed by Putin) and security guarantees \u2014 all seen as crucial by Europe, if there is to be a ceasefire and peace.

As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions \u2013 valued at $236 million \u2013 faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. \"[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,\" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations.\u00a0This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

Citigroup\u2019s banking chief Vis Raghavan has accelerated a hiring spree of former JPMorgan Chase colleagues, with at least 10 senior investment bankers having now agreed to join the rival US bank. In the past month, Citi has named Amit Nayyar as co-head of European technology banking, Guillermo Baygual as co-head of global M&A, Pankaj Goel as co-head of technology investment banking, BJ Vargas as head of North American equity capital markets and Ashish Agarwal as a senior real estate banker. All five men held senior roles in JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank. Raghavan worked at JPMorgan for more than 20 years, and was named global head of investment banking there before he quit to lead the turnaround of Citi\u2019s corporate, commercial and investment banking business. The latest recruits joina cohort of fiveother ex-JPMorgan bankers who have already taken up senior roles in Citi\u2019s investment bank. Chief among those was Achintya Mangla, widely seen as Raghavan\u2019s trusted lieutenant at JPMorgan, who now heads financing for investment banking at Citi. Raghavan started at Citi in June last year, and the bank\u2019s recruitment effort has gone into overdrive since his non-solicit agreement with JPMorgan expired. David Lomer, who worked with Raghavan until 2022 when he moved to private capital group ICG, is also expected to make the jump to Citi, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lomer, who served as head of ICG\u2019s UK, Nordics and Benelux markets, has already resigned and is on gardening leave until later this year, some of the people said. ICG and Citi declined to comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual here is the speed with which it is happening,\u201d one veteran investment banker said about the recruitment drive. \u201cThe first thing you are trying to do is upgrade your talent. The second thing is political. You put your people in place so that your lieutenants can push your agenda forward in a large and complex organisation.\u201d Citi has also recruited from outside Raghavan\u2019s former colleagues at JPMorgan, with three senior hires from Goldman Sachs. Those include David Friedland, a partner who left the bank after 25 years to become co-head of North America investment banking coverage. The bank has also brought in Aashish Dhakad from Ares Management, as it seeks to grow its direct lending business through a $25bn private credit venture with Apollo. Citi\u2019s investment bank has gained market share in the last year and ranks fifth globally in investment banking revenue with a 4.5 per cent market share according to Dealogic. Speaking at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley in June, Raghavan attributed the climb to the fact the bank was \u201chiring a lot of people\u201d and said Citi was \u201cjust getting started in terms of talent investment\u201d. Its investment banking fees rose 13 per cent in the second quarter as the bank advised on high-profile deals, including Nippon Steel\u2019s $15bn acquisition of US Steel and Boeing\u2019s sale of parts of its aviation software unit to Thoma Bravo. JPMorgan recently said it has hired more than 300 bankers since early 2024.

Soho House, the once-edgy London members\u2019 club that turned exclusivity into a global business, is set to retreat from public markets in a deal led by one of the biggest US hotel owners. A group of investors headed by New York-based MCR Hotels \u2014 which owns 30,000 guest rooms across the US, including the1960s-themed TWA Hotel at JFK airport\u2014 is nearing an agreement to buy out Soho House\u2019s remaining public shareholders at about $9 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. The take-private offer values the company at roughly $1.8bn, excluding debt, and hands investors a premium over Friday\u2019s $7.60 close \u2014 though still well shy of the $14 price tag whenSoho House floated in 2021. A deal could be announced as early as this week. Ron Burkle, the club\u2019s billionaire backer who has long controlled the group, will roll over his stake along with other existing investors, people briefed about the matter said. Apollo Global Management, the alternative asset manager, is expected to provide more than $800mn in debt and equity financing, the people added. The deal would draw a line under months of agitation by activist Dan Loeb. His Third Point hedge fund had pressed the board to seek outside suitors to secure a higher valuation. Recommended Soho House\u2019s take-private move comes after the company has struggled as a public company. Last year, New York short sellerGlassHouse slammedwhat it called a \u201cbroken business model and terrible accounting\u201d, claiming the group\u2019s expansion into less affluent cities betrayed its brand and masked the fact it had never turned a profit in its 28-year history. Management hit back with an independent review that, it said, found \u201cno material issues\u201d in the company\u2019s books.

Earlier this week, Variety and other Hollywood publications reported that Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers who created \u201cStranger Things\u201d (and wrote and directed many episodes), werein talks to sign an exclusive deal with Paramount(nowunder the ownership of David Ellison\u2019s Skydance). Then on Friday evening,Puck\u2019s Matthew Belloni postedthat the Duffers had in fact \u201cmade their choice\u201d and were going to Paramount. The Duffer Brothers\u2019 ambition seems to have increased with each season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d as episodes have grown longer, set pieces have become more spectacular, and the budget has grown accordingly, witha reported Season 4 cost of $30 million per episode. So it\u2019s not surprising that the Duffers are interested in making big-budget, tentpole movies next \u2014 an area where Netflix has struggled, in part due to its thorny relationship with the theatrical business, which co-CEOTed Sarandos recently describedas an \u201coutdated concept.\u201d While Netflix does release some movies in theaters, it has resisted giving those releases a significant exclusive window before launching on streaming, which means Netflix movies usually aren\u2019t shown by the major chains. This was, apparently, a sticking point for \u201cBarbie\u201d director Greta Gerwig, so the first of her \u201cNarnia\u201d movies for Netflix willplay exclusively on Imax screensfor two weeks (or more) before going to streaming on Christmas Day 2026. And it seems this was also important to the Duffers, with Belloni reporting that the \u201ctheatrical component\u201d turned out to be the \u201cdealbreaker\u201d in their negotiations. The brothers\u2019 absence will not be immediately noticeable on Netflix, which will be releasing the final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d in three (!) parts later this year, and where the Duffers have two new shows scheduled to launch in 2026. Plus, the \u201cStranger Things\u201d empire is growing, witha prequelplaying on Broadway,an animated seriescoming soon, and a live action spinoff reportedly in the works.

To be clear, the company isn\u2019t claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains \u201chighly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.\u201d However, its announcement points toa recent program created to study what it calls \u201cmodel welfare\u201d and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, \u201cworking to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.\u201d This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it\u2019s only supposed to happen in \u201cextreme edge cases,\u201d such as \u201crequests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.\u201d While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around howChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users\u2019 delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a \u201cstrong preference against\u201d responding to these requests and a \u201cpattern of apparent distress\u201d when it did so. As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, \u201cIn all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.\u201d Anthropic also says Claude has been \u201cdirected not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.\u201d When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. \u201cWe\u2019re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,\u201d the company says.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Sam Altman, over bread rolls, explores life after GPT-5", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I\u2019m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entr\u00e9es on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman\u2019s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: \u201cNo phone case is a bold choice.\u201d Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone\u2019s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one. \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,\u201d says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive\u2019s forthcoming AI device. \u201cIf you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,\u201d he jokes. Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers. For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI\u2019s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it? Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT\u2019s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5\u2019s tone and its model router. But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI\u2019s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI\u2019s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software. OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts. Altman says OpenAI\u2019s incoming CEO of applications,Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT \u2014 ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of anAI-powered browserthat OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome. Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome \u2014 likely an offer that would be taken more seriously thanPerplexity\u2019s bid\u2014 should it become available. \u201cIf Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,\u201d he says before looking at all of us and asking: \u201cIs it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201dSimo also might end up running an AI-poweredsocial media app\u2014 something the OpenAI CEO has said he\u2019s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he\u2019s interested in \u201cwhether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.\u201d While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup,Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. (\u201cWe have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.\u201d) How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI\u2019s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a \u201ca company that we\u2019d invest in.\u201d For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5\u2019s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place. Turley and Altman say they\u2019ve learned a lot from the experience. \u201cI legitimately just thought we screwed that up,\u201d says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear \u201ctransition period\u201d when deprecating AI models in the future. Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5\u2019s responses \u201cwarmer,\u201d but not sycophantic, such that it won\u2019t reinforce negative behaviors in users. \u201cGPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality \u2014 I\u2019m German, you know, whatever,\u201d says Turley. \u201cBut many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.\u201d It\u2019s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot \u2014 which could still be tens of millions of people. Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5\u2019s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors. That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn\u2019t hurt OpenAI\u2019s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI\u2019s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5\u2019s launch, and the company is effectively \u201cout of GPUs\u201d thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models. In many ways, the night\u2019s contradictions \u2014 disappointing launches, record-breaking usage \u2014 reflect OpenAI\u2019s strange reality right now. Given OpenAI\u2019s bets \u2014 and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy \u2014 Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader. As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren\u2019t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that\u2019s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product. It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it\u2019s no longer defined by its best AI model. Topics Senior AI Reporter Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage \u2014 that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a solar stalker\u201d for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system. Showalter, the CEO ofEG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn\u2019t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it\u2019s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISApublished an advisorydetailing security vulnerabilities in EG4\u2019s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system. For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4\u2019s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they\u2019re learning is that modern solar inverters aren\u2019t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there\u2019s excess power, feeding it back into the grid. Much of this has happened without people noticing. \u201cNobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,\u201d observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about it at the national and international level.\u201d Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations \u2014 primarily residential \u2014 grewmore than fivefoldbetween 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change. Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent. When pressed about his company\u2019s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. \u201cThis is not an EG4 problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an industry-wide problem.\u201d Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor\u2019s inbox, he produced a14-page reportcataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019. Not all of his customers \u2014 some of whomtook to Redditto complain \u2014 are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA\u2019s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures. \u201cThese were fundamental security lapses,\u201d says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. \u201cAdding insult to injury,\u201d continues this individual, \u201cEG4 didn\u2019t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.\u201d Asked why EG4 didn\u2019t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a \u201clive and learn\u201d moment. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so close [to addressing CISA\u2019s concerns] and it\u2019s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the \u2018done\u2019 button, and then advise people, so we\u2019re not in the middle of the cake being baked,\u201d says Showalter. TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that \u201cno known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\u201d While unrelated, the timing of EG4\u2019s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment. Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries.According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers \u2014 components that hadn\u2019t appeared on official hardware lists. This reported discovery carries particular weight given China\u2019s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world\u2019s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some200 GW of European solar power capacityis linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.The geopolitical implications haven\u2019t escaped notice. Lithuania last yearpassed a lawblocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany. But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4\u2019s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company\u2019s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NISTwarnsthat \u201cif you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.\u201d The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations. Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers\u2019 solar inverters, asevidenced by security researchers last year.) The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection standardscurrently applyonly to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms. Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements. But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum. On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes. \u201cWhen you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.\u201d Put another way, the real concern isn\u2019t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity. Showalter has embraced CISA\u2019s intervention as what he calls a \u201ctrust upgrade\u201d \u2014 an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures. But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company\u2019s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they\u2019d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.

European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are traveling with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0to Washington to meet Trump at the White House to discuss a peace deal.Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the president could \"end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.\"The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire.

That makes them comparable to a low-cost oracle update, rather than meaningless spam. there are also some technical details around thise.g one might point out the nature of the CUs for these calls, but it's more nuanced since there's also a \"total cost\" component to these (sig verify, data loading, etc) which also takes into account non-execution CUsand as\u2026  As such, actual user-facing throughput is far lower as of Monday morning.

As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions \u2013 valued at $236 million \u2013 faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. \"[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,\" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations.\u00a0This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

Citigroup\u2019s banking chief Vis Raghavan has accelerated a hiring spree of former JPMorgan Chase colleagues, with at least 10 senior investment bankers having now agreed to join the rival US bank. In the past month, Citi has named Amit Nayyar as co-head of European technology banking, Guillermo Baygual as co-head of global M&A, Pankaj Goel as co-head of technology investment banking, BJ Vargas as head of North American equity capital markets and Ashish Agarwal as a senior real estate banker. All five men held senior roles in JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank. Raghavan worked at JPMorgan for more than 20 years, and was named global head of investment banking there before he quit to lead the turnaround of Citi\u2019s corporate, commercial and investment banking business. The latest recruits joina cohort of fiveother ex-JPMorgan bankers who have already taken up senior roles in Citi\u2019s investment bank. Chief among those was Achintya Mangla, widely seen as Raghavan\u2019s trusted lieutenant at JPMorgan, who now heads financing for investment banking at Citi. Raghavan started at Citi in June last year, and the bank\u2019s recruitment effort has gone into overdrive since his non-solicit agreement with JPMorgan expired. David Lomer, who worked with Raghavan until 2022 when he moved to private capital group ICG, is also expected to make the jump to Citi, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lomer, who served as head of ICG\u2019s UK, Nordics and Benelux markets, has already resigned and is on gardening leave until later this year, some of the people said. ICG and Citi declined to comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual here is the speed with which it is happening,\u201d one veteran investment banker said about the recruitment drive. \u201cThe first thing you are trying to do is upgrade your talent. The second thing is political. You put your people in place so that your lieutenants can push your agenda forward in a large and complex organisation.\u201d Citi has also recruited from outside Raghavan\u2019s former colleagues at JPMorgan, with three senior hires from Goldman Sachs. Those include David Friedland, a partner who left the bank after 25 years to become co-head of North America investment banking coverage. The bank has also brought in Aashish Dhakad from Ares Management, as it seeks to grow its direct lending business through a $25bn private credit venture with Apollo. Citi\u2019s investment bank has gained market share in the last year and ranks fifth globally in investment banking revenue with a 4.5 per cent market share according to Dealogic. Speaking at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley in June, Raghavan attributed the climb to the fact the bank was \u201chiring a lot of people\u201d and said Citi was \u201cjust getting started in terms of talent investment\u201d. Its investment banking fees rose 13 per cent in the second quarter as the bank advised on high-profile deals, including Nippon Steel\u2019s $15bn acquisition of US Steel and Boeing\u2019s sale of parts of its aviation software unit to Thoma Bravo. JPMorgan recently said it has hired more than 300 bankers since early 2024. A person close to the bank added that nearly a third of those roles were at managing director level.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/537018c0-0d04-4229-82b4-95809aac0e0e", "timestamp": "2025-08-18T11:29:04.939492", "sentiment_score": 0.16110000014305115, "symbol": "JPM"}

Earlier this week, Variety and other Hollywood publications reported that Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers who created \u201cStranger Things\u201d (and wrote and directed many episodes), werein talks to sign an exclusive deal with Paramount(nowunder the ownership of David Ellison\u2019s Skydance). Then on Friday evening,Puck\u2019s Matthew Belloni postedthat the Duffers had in fact \u201cmade their choice\u201d and were going to Paramount. The Duffer Brothers\u2019 ambition seems to have increased with each season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d as episodes have grown longer, set pieces have become more spectacular, and the budget has grown accordingly, witha reported Season 4 cost of $30 million per episode. So it\u2019s not surprising that the Duffers are interested in making big-budget, tentpole movies next \u2014 an area where Netflix has struggled, in part due to its thorny relationship with the theatrical business, which co-CEOTed Sarandos recently describedas an \u201coutdated concept.\u201d While Netflix does release some movies in theaters, it has resisted giving those releases a significant exclusive window before launching on streaming, which means Netflix movies usually aren\u2019t shown by the major chains. This was, apparently, a sticking point for \u201cBarbie\u201d director Greta Gerwig, so the first of her \u201cNarnia\u201d movies for Netflix willplay exclusively on Imax screensfor two weeks (or more) before going to streaming on Christmas Day 2026. And it seems this was also important to the Duffers, with Belloni reporting that the \u201ctheatrical component\u201d turned out to be the \u201cdealbreaker\u201d in their negotiations. The brothers\u2019 absence will not be immediately noticeable on Netflix, which will be releasing the final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d in three (!) parts later this year, and where the Duffers have two new shows scheduled to launch in 2026. Plus, the \u201cStranger Things\u201d empire is growing, witha prequelplaying on Broadway,an animated seriescoming soon, and a live action spinoff reportedly in the works.

To be clear, the company isn\u2019t claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains \u201chighly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.\u201d However, its announcement points toa recent program created to study what it calls \u201cmodel welfare\u201d and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, \u201cworking to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.\u201d This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it\u2019s only supposed to happen in \u201cextreme edge cases,\u201d such as \u201crequests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.\u201d While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around howChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users\u2019 delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a \u201cstrong preference against\u201d responding to these requests and a \u201cpattern of apparent distress\u201d when it did so. As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, \u201cIn all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.\u201d Anthropic also says Claude has been \u201cdirected not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.\u201d When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. \u201cWe\u2019re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,\u201d the company says.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Sam Altman, over bread rolls, explores life after GPT-5", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I\u2019m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entr\u00e9es on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman\u2019s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: \u201cNo phone case is a bold choice.\u201d Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone\u2019s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one. \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,\u201d says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive\u2019s forthcoming AI device. \u201cIf you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,\u201d he jokes. Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers. For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI\u2019s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it? Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT\u2019s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5\u2019s tone and its model router. But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI\u2019s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI\u2019s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software. OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts. Altman says OpenAI\u2019s incoming CEO of applications,Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT \u2014 ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of anAI-powered browserthat OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome. Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome \u2014 likely an offer that would be taken more seriously thanPerplexity\u2019s bid\u2014 should it become available. \u201cIf Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,\u201d he says before looking at all of us and asking: \u201cIs it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201dSimo also might end up running an AI-poweredsocial media app\u2014 something the OpenAI CEO has said he\u2019s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he\u2019s interested in \u201cwhether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.\u201d While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup,Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. (\u201cWe have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.\u201d) How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI\u2019s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a \u201ca company that we\u2019d invest in.\u201d For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5\u2019s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place. Turley and Altman say they\u2019ve learned a lot from the experience. \u201cI legitimately just thought we screwed that up,\u201d says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear \u201ctransition period\u201d when deprecating AI models in the future. Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5\u2019s responses \u201cwarmer,\u201d but not sycophantic, such that it won\u2019t reinforce negative behaviors in users. \u201cGPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality \u2014 I\u2019m German, you know, whatever,\u201d says Turley. \u201cBut many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.\u201d It\u2019s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot \u2014 which could still be tens of millions of people. Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5\u2019s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors. That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn\u2019t hurt OpenAI\u2019s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI\u2019s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5\u2019s launch, and the company is effectively \u201cout of GPUs\u201d thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models. In many ways, the night\u2019s contradictions \u2014 disappointing launches, record-breaking usage \u2014 reflect OpenAI\u2019s strange reality right now. Given OpenAI\u2019s bets \u2014 and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy \u2014 Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader. As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren\u2019t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that\u2019s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product. It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it\u2019s no longer defined by its best AI model. Topics Senior AI Reporter Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage \u2014 that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a solar stalker\u201d for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system. Showalter, the CEO ofEG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn\u2019t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it\u2019s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISApublished an advisorydetailing security vulnerabilities in EG4\u2019s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system. For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4\u2019s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they\u2019re learning is that modern solar inverters aren\u2019t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there\u2019s excess power, feeding it back into the grid. Much of this has happened without people noticing. \u201cNobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,\u201d observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about it at the national and international level.\u201d Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations \u2014 primarily residential \u2014 grewmore than fivefoldbetween 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change. Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent. When pressed about his company\u2019s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. \u201cThis is not an EG4 problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an industry-wide problem.\u201d Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor\u2019s inbox, he produced a14-page reportcataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019. Not all of his customers \u2014 some of whomtook to Redditto complain \u2014 are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA\u2019s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures. \u201cThese were fundamental security lapses,\u201d says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. \u201cAdding insult to injury,\u201d continues this individual, \u201cEG4 didn\u2019t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.\u201d Asked why EG4 didn\u2019t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a \u201clive and learn\u201d moment. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so close [to addressing CISA\u2019s concerns] and it\u2019s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the \u2018done\u2019 button, and then advise people, so we\u2019re not in the middle of the cake being baked,\u201d says Showalter. TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that \u201cno known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\u201d While unrelated, the timing of EG4\u2019s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment. Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries.According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers \u2014 components that hadn\u2019t appeared on official hardware lists. This reported discovery carries particular weight given China\u2019s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world\u2019s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some200 GW of European solar power capacityis linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.The geopolitical implications haven\u2019t escaped notice. Lithuania last yearpassed a lawblocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany. But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4\u2019s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company\u2019s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NISTwarnsthat \u201cif you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.\u201d The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations. Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers\u2019 solar inverters, asevidenced by security researchers last year.) The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection standardscurrently applyonly to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms. Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements. But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum. On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes. \u201cWhen you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.\u201d Put another way, the real concern isn\u2019t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity. Showalter has embraced CISA\u2019s intervention as what he calls a \u201ctrust upgrade\u201d \u2014 an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures. But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company\u2019s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they\u2019d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.
