European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are traveling with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0to Washington to meet Trump at the White House to discuss a peace deal.Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the president could \"end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.\"The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire.

Global markets were on tenterhooks Monday as momentum to end the war in Ukraine appeared to be ramping up, with European leaders heading to Washington for more talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.European markets traded mixedahead of the summit later today at the White House, which followsTrump's high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putinin Alaska on Friday, whileU.S. stock futures had moved lower.Meanwhile,Asia-Pacific indicesovernight traded mostly higher in anticipation of the talks.Traders will be hoping that an end to the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a conflict which began in 2022 and which has shaken the global economy, disrupting trade and supply chains, and creating geopolitical chasms between major economies in the West and East \u2014 could be nearer now than at any other time.But those in the know say fledgling talks between stakeholders Russia, Ukraine, Europe and the U.S. are just the beginning of what could be a long and thorny path to a ceasefire \u2014 as Trump's inconclusive talks with Putin on Friday proved \u2014 let alone peace.That would be in stark contrast to Trump's well-documented love of a quick deal, and should be a wake-up call for global market optimism, experts say.\"Peace agreements take a very, very long time to achieve,\" James Bindenagel, visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, told CNBC Monday. \"And what Putin has said is that he wants peace talks so he can continue the war, knowing that it won't come to a peace agreement for a very long time. That is simply not acceptable,\" he said.\"You cannot negotiate on a peace agreement for five years, ten years, and let the Russians continue their war against the Ukrainians.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO chief Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are among the European leaders traveling to Washington for talks on Monday.They're accompanying Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0to discuss Ukraine's future and possible conditions for a peace deal, including land swaps (reportedly proposed by Putin) and security guarantees \u2014 all seen as crucial by Europe, if there is to be a ceasefire and peace.

As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions \u2013 valued at $236 million \u2013 faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. \"[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,\" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations.\u00a0This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

Citigroup\u2019s banking chief Vis Raghavan has accelerated a hiring spree of former JPMorgan Chase colleagues, with at least 10 senior investment bankers having now agreed to join the rival US bank. In the past month, Citi has named Amit Nayyar as co-head of European technology banking, Guillermo Baygual as co-head of global M&A, Pankaj Goel as co-head of technology investment banking, BJ Vargas as head of North American equity capital markets and Ashish Agarwal as a senior real estate banker. All five men held senior roles in JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank. Raghavan worked at JPMorgan for more than 20 years, and was named global head of investment banking there before he quit to lead the turnaround of Citi\u2019s corporate, commercial and investment banking business. The latest recruits joina cohort of fiveother ex-JPMorgan bankers who have already taken up senior roles in Citi\u2019s investment bank. Chief among those was Achintya Mangla, widely seen as Raghavan\u2019s trusted lieutenant at JPMorgan, who now heads financing for investment banking at Citi. Raghavan started at Citi in June last year, and the bank\u2019s recruitment effort has gone into overdrive since his non-solicit agreement with JPMorgan expired. David Lomer, who worked with Raghavan until 2022 when he moved to private capital group ICG, is also expected to make the jump to Citi, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lomer, who served as head of ICG\u2019s UK, Nordics and Benelux markets, has already resigned and is on gardening leave until later this year, some of the people said. ICG and Citi declined to comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual here is the speed with which it is happening,\u201d one veteran investment banker said about the recruitment drive. \u201cThe first thing you are trying to do is upgrade your talent. The second thing is political. You put your people in place so that your lieutenants can push your agenda forward in a large and complex organisation.\u201d Citi has also recruited from outside Raghavan\u2019s former colleagues at JPMorgan, with three senior hires from Goldman Sachs. Those include David Friedland, a partner who left the bank after 25 years to become co-head of North America investment banking coverage. The bank has also brought in Aashish Dhakad from Ares Management, as it seeks to grow its direct lending business through a $25bn private credit venture with Apollo. Citi\u2019s investment bank has gained market share in the last year and ranks fifth globally in investment banking revenue with a 4.5 per cent market share according to Dealogic. Speaking at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley in June, Raghavan attributed the climb to the fact the bank was \u201chiring a lot of people\u201d and said Citi was \u201cjust getting started in terms of talent investment\u201d. Its investment banking fees rose 13 per cent in the second quarter as the bank advised on high-profile deals, including Nippon Steel\u2019s $15bn acquisition of US Steel and Boeing\u2019s sale of parts of its aviation software unit to Thoma Bravo. JPMorgan recently said it has hired more than 300 bankers since early 2024.

Soho House, the once-edgy London members\u2019 club that turned exclusivity into a global business, is set to retreat from public markets in a deal led by one of the biggest US hotel owners. A group of investors headed by New York-based MCR Hotels \u2014 which owns 30,000 guest rooms across the US, including the1960s-themed TWA Hotel at JFK airport\u2014 is nearing an agreement to buy out Soho House\u2019s remaining public shareholders at about $9 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. The take-private offer values the company at roughly $1.8bn, excluding debt, and hands investors a premium over Friday\u2019s $7.60 close \u2014 though still well shy of the $14 price tag whenSoho House floated in 2021. A deal could be announced as early as this week. Ron Burkle, the club\u2019s billionaire backer who has long controlled the group, will roll over his stake along with other existing investors, people briefed about the matter said. Apollo Global Management, the alternative asset manager, is expected to provide more than $800mn in debt and equity financing, the people added. The deal would draw a line under months of agitation by activist Dan Loeb. His Third Point hedge fund had pressed the board to seek outside suitors to secure a higher valuation. Recommended Soho House\u2019s take-private move comes after the company has struggled as a public company. Last year, New York short sellerGlassHouse slammedwhat it called a \u201cbroken business model and terrible accounting\u201d, claiming the group\u2019s expansion into less affluent cities betrayed its brand and masked the fact it had never turned a profit in its 28-year history. Management hit back with an independent review that, it said, found \u201cno material issues\u201d in the company\u2019s books.

Earlier this week, Variety and other Hollywood publications reported that Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers who created \u201cStranger Things\u201d (and wrote and directed many episodes), werein talks to sign an exclusive deal with Paramount(nowunder the ownership of David Ellison\u2019s Skydance). Then on Friday evening,Puck\u2019s Matthew Belloni postedthat the Duffers had in fact \u201cmade their choice\u201d and were going to Paramount. The Duffer Brothers\u2019 ambition seems to have increased with each season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d as episodes have grown longer, set pieces have become more spectacular, and the budget has grown accordingly, witha reported Season 4 cost of $30 million per episode. So it\u2019s not surprising that the Duffers are interested in making big-budget, tentpole movies next \u2014 an area where Netflix has struggled, in part due to its thorny relationship with the theatrical business, which co-CEOTed Sarandos recently describedas an \u201coutdated concept.\u201d While Netflix does release some movies in theaters, it has resisted giving those releases a significant exclusive window before launching on streaming, which means Netflix movies usually aren\u2019t shown by the major chains. This was, apparently, a sticking point for \u201cBarbie\u201d director Greta Gerwig, so the first of her \u201cNarnia\u201d movies for Netflix willplay exclusively on Imax screensfor two weeks (or more) before going to streaming on Christmas Day 2026. And it seems this was also important to the Duffers, with Belloni reporting that the \u201ctheatrical component\u201d turned out to be the \u201cdealbreaker\u201d in their negotiations. The brothers\u2019 absence will not be immediately noticeable on Netflix, which will be releasing the final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d in three (!) parts later this year, and where the Duffers have two new shows scheduled to launch in 2026. Plus, the \u201cStranger Things\u201d empire is growing, witha prequelplaying on Broadway,an animated seriescoming soon, and a live action spinoff reportedly in the works.

To be clear, the company isn\u2019t claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains \u201chighly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.\u201d However, its announcement points toa recent program created to study what it calls \u201cmodel welfare\u201d and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, \u201cworking to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.\u201d This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it\u2019s only supposed to happen in \u201cextreme edge cases,\u201d such as \u201crequests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.\u201d While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around howChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users\u2019 delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a \u201cstrong preference against\u201d responding to these requests and a \u201cpattern of apparent distress\u201d when it did so. As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, \u201cIn all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.\u201d Anthropic also says Claude has been \u201cdirected not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.\u201d When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. \u201cWe\u2019re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,\u201d the company says.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Sam Altman, over bread rolls, explores life after GPT-5", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I\u2019m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entr\u00e9es on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman\u2019s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: \u201cNo phone case is a bold choice.\u201d Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone\u2019s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one. \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,\u201d says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive\u2019s forthcoming AI device. \u201cIf you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,\u201d he jokes. Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers. For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI\u2019s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it? Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT\u2019s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5\u2019s tone and its model router. But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI\u2019s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI\u2019s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software. OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts. Altman says OpenAI\u2019s incoming CEO of applications,Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT \u2014 ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of anAI-powered browserthat OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome. Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome \u2014 likely an offer that would be taken more seriously thanPerplexity\u2019s bid\u2014 should it become available. \u201cIf Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,\u201d he says before looking at all of us and asking: \u201cIs it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201dSimo also might end up running an AI-poweredsocial media app\u2014 something the OpenAI CEO has said he\u2019s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he\u2019s interested in \u201cwhether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.\u201d While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup,Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. (\u201cWe have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.\u201d) How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI\u2019s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a \u201ca company that we\u2019d invest in.\u201d For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5\u2019s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place. Turley and Altman say they\u2019ve learned a lot from the experience. \u201cI legitimately just thought we screwed that up,\u201d says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear \u201ctransition period\u201d when deprecating AI models in the future. Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5\u2019s responses \u201cwarmer,\u201d but not sycophantic, such that it won\u2019t reinforce negative behaviors in users. \u201cGPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality \u2014 I\u2019m German, you know, whatever,\u201d says Turley. \u201cBut many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.\u201d It\u2019s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot \u2014 which could still be tens of millions of people. Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5\u2019s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors. That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn\u2019t hurt OpenAI\u2019s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI\u2019s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5\u2019s launch, and the company is effectively \u201cout of GPUs\u201d thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models. In many ways, the night\u2019s contradictions \u2014 disappointing launches, record-breaking usage \u2014 reflect OpenAI\u2019s strange reality right now. Given OpenAI\u2019s bets \u2014 and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy \u2014 Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader. As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren\u2019t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that\u2019s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product. It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it\u2019s no longer defined by its best AI model. Topics Senior AI Reporter Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage \u2014 that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a solar stalker\u201d for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system. Showalter, the CEO ofEG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn\u2019t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it\u2019s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISApublished an advisorydetailing security vulnerabilities in EG4\u2019s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system. For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4\u2019s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they\u2019re learning is that modern solar inverters aren\u2019t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there\u2019s excess power, feeding it back into the grid. Much of this has happened without people noticing. \u201cNobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,\u201d observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about it at the national and international level.\u201d Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations \u2014 primarily residential \u2014 grewmore than fivefoldbetween 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change. Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent. When pressed about his company\u2019s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. \u201cThis is not an EG4 problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an industry-wide problem.\u201d Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor\u2019s inbox, he produced a14-page reportcataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019. Not all of his customers \u2014 some of whomtook to Redditto complain \u2014 are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA\u2019s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures. \u201cThese were fundamental security lapses,\u201d says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. \u201cAdding insult to injury,\u201d continues this individual, \u201cEG4 didn\u2019t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.\u201d Asked why EG4 didn\u2019t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a \u201clive and learn\u201d moment. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so close [to addressing CISA\u2019s concerns] and it\u2019s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the \u2018done\u2019 button, and then advise people, so we\u2019re not in the middle of the cake being baked,\u201d says Showalter. TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that \u201cno known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\u201d While unrelated, the timing of EG4\u2019s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment. Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries.According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers \u2014 components that hadn\u2019t appeared on official hardware lists. This reported discovery carries particular weight given China\u2019s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world\u2019s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some200 GW of European solar power capacityis linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.The geopolitical implications haven\u2019t escaped notice. Lithuania last yearpassed a lawblocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany. But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4\u2019s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company\u2019s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NISTwarnsthat \u201cif you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.\u201d The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations. Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers\u2019 solar inverters, asevidenced by security researchers last year.) The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection standardscurrently applyonly to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms. Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements. But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum. On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes. \u201cWhen you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.\u201d Put another way, the real concern isn\u2019t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity. Showalter has embraced CISA\u2019s intervention as what he calls a \u201ctrust upgrade\u201d \u2014 an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures. But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company\u2019s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they\u2019d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.

European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are traveling with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0to Washington to meet Trump at the White House to discuss a peace deal.Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the president could \"end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.\"The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire.

That makes them comparable to a low-cost oracle update, rather than meaningless spam. there are also some technical details around thise.g one might point out the nature of the CUs for these calls, but it's more nuanced since there's also a \"total cost\" component to these (sig verify, data loading, etc) which also takes into account non-execution CUsand as\u2026  As such, actual user-facing throughput is far lower as of Monday morning.

As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions \u2013 valued at $236 million \u2013 faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. \"[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,\" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations.\u00a0This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

Citigroup\u2019s banking chief Vis Raghavan has accelerated a hiring spree of former JPMorgan Chase colleagues, with at least 10 senior investment bankers having now agreed to join the rival US bank. In the past month, Citi has named Amit Nayyar as co-head of European technology banking, Guillermo Baygual as co-head of global M&A, Pankaj Goel as co-head of technology investment banking, BJ Vargas as head of North American equity capital markets and Ashish Agarwal as a senior real estate banker. All five men held senior roles in JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank. Raghavan worked at JPMorgan for more than 20 years, and was named global head of investment banking there before he quit to lead the turnaround of Citi\u2019s corporate, commercial and investment banking business. The latest recruits joina cohort of fiveother ex-JPMorgan bankers who have already taken up senior roles in Citi\u2019s investment bank. Chief among those was Achintya Mangla, widely seen as Raghavan\u2019s trusted lieutenant at JPMorgan, who now heads financing for investment banking at Citi. Raghavan started at Citi in June last year, and the bank\u2019s recruitment effort has gone into overdrive since his non-solicit agreement with JPMorgan expired. David Lomer, who worked with Raghavan until 2022 when he moved to private capital group ICG, is also expected to make the jump to Citi, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lomer, who served as head of ICG\u2019s UK, Nordics and Benelux markets, has already resigned and is on gardening leave until later this year, some of the people said. ICG and Citi declined to comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual here is the speed with which it is happening,\u201d one veteran investment banker said about the recruitment drive. \u201cThe first thing you are trying to do is upgrade your talent. The second thing is political. You put your people in place so that your lieutenants can push your agenda forward in a large and complex organisation.\u201d Citi has also recruited from outside Raghavan\u2019s former colleagues at JPMorgan, with three senior hires from Goldman Sachs. Those include David Friedland, a partner who left the bank after 25 years to become co-head of North America investment banking coverage. The bank has also brought in Aashish Dhakad from Ares Management, as it seeks to grow its direct lending business through a $25bn private credit venture with Apollo. Citi\u2019s investment bank has gained market share in the last year and ranks fifth globally in investment banking revenue with a 4.5 per cent market share according to Dealogic. Speaking at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley in June, Raghavan attributed the climb to the fact the bank was \u201chiring a lot of people\u201d and said Citi was \u201cjust getting started in terms of talent investment\u201d. Its investment banking fees rose 13 per cent in the second quarter as the bank advised on high-profile deals, including Nippon Steel\u2019s $15bn acquisition of US Steel and Boeing\u2019s sale of parts of its aviation software unit to Thoma Bravo. JPMorgan recently said it has hired more than 300 bankers since early 2024. A person close to the bank added that nearly a third of those roles were at managing director level.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/537018c0-0d04-4229-82b4-95809aac0e0e", "timestamp": "2025-08-18T11:29:04.939492", "sentiment_score": 0.16110000014305115, "symbol": "JPM"}

Earlier this week, Variety and other Hollywood publications reported that Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers who created \u201cStranger Things\u201d (and wrote and directed many episodes), werein talks to sign an exclusive deal with Paramount(nowunder the ownership of David Ellison\u2019s Skydance). Then on Friday evening,Puck\u2019s Matthew Belloni postedthat the Duffers had in fact \u201cmade their choice\u201d and were going to Paramount. The Duffer Brothers\u2019 ambition seems to have increased with each season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d as episodes have grown longer, set pieces have become more spectacular, and the budget has grown accordingly, witha reported Season 4 cost of $30 million per episode. So it\u2019s not surprising that the Duffers are interested in making big-budget, tentpole movies next \u2014 an area where Netflix has struggled, in part due to its thorny relationship with the theatrical business, which co-CEOTed Sarandos recently describedas an \u201coutdated concept.\u201d While Netflix does release some movies in theaters, it has resisted giving those releases a significant exclusive window before launching on streaming, which means Netflix movies usually aren\u2019t shown by the major chains. This was, apparently, a sticking point for \u201cBarbie\u201d director Greta Gerwig, so the first of her \u201cNarnia\u201d movies for Netflix willplay exclusively on Imax screensfor two weeks (or more) before going to streaming on Christmas Day 2026. And it seems this was also important to the Duffers, with Belloni reporting that the \u201ctheatrical component\u201d turned out to be the \u201cdealbreaker\u201d in their negotiations. The brothers\u2019 absence will not be immediately noticeable on Netflix, which will be releasing the final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d in three (!) parts later this year, and where the Duffers have two new shows scheduled to launch in 2026. Plus, the \u201cStranger Things\u201d empire is growing, witha prequelplaying on Broadway,an animated seriescoming soon, and a live action spinoff reportedly in the works.

To be clear, the company isn\u2019t claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains \u201chighly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.\u201d However, its announcement points toa recent program created to study what it calls \u201cmodel welfare\u201d and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, \u201cworking to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.\u201d This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it\u2019s only supposed to happen in \u201cextreme edge cases,\u201d such as \u201crequests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.\u201d While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around howChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users\u2019 delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a \u201cstrong preference against\u201d responding to these requests and a \u201cpattern of apparent distress\u201d when it did so. As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, \u201cIn all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.\u201d Anthropic also says Claude has been \u201cdirected not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.\u201d When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. \u201cWe\u2019re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,\u201d the company says.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Sam Altman, over bread rolls, explores life after GPT-5", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I\u2019m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entr\u00e9es on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman\u2019s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: \u201cNo phone case is a bold choice.\u201d Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone\u2019s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one. \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,\u201d says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive\u2019s forthcoming AI device. \u201cIf you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,\u201d he jokes. Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers. For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI\u2019s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it? Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT\u2019s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5\u2019s tone and its model router. But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI\u2019s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI\u2019s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software. OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts. Altman says OpenAI\u2019s incoming CEO of applications,Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT \u2014 ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of anAI-powered browserthat OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome. Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome \u2014 likely an offer that would be taken more seriously thanPerplexity\u2019s bid\u2014 should it become available. \u201cIf Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,\u201d he says before looking at all of us and asking: \u201cIs it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201dSimo also might end up running an AI-poweredsocial media app\u2014 something the OpenAI CEO has said he\u2019s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he\u2019s interested in \u201cwhether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.\u201d While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup,Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. (\u201cWe have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.\u201d) How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI\u2019s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a \u201ca company that we\u2019d invest in.\u201d For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5\u2019s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place. Turley and Altman say they\u2019ve learned a lot from the experience. \u201cI legitimately just thought we screwed that up,\u201d says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear \u201ctransition period\u201d when deprecating AI models in the future. Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5\u2019s responses \u201cwarmer,\u201d but not sycophantic, such that it won\u2019t reinforce negative behaviors in users. \u201cGPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality \u2014 I\u2019m German, you know, whatever,\u201d says Turley. \u201cBut many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.\u201d It\u2019s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot \u2014 which could still be tens of millions of people. Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5\u2019s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors. That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn\u2019t hurt OpenAI\u2019s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI\u2019s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5\u2019s launch, and the company is effectively \u201cout of GPUs\u201d thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models. In many ways, the night\u2019s contradictions \u2014 disappointing launches, record-breaking usage \u2014 reflect OpenAI\u2019s strange reality right now. Given OpenAI\u2019s bets \u2014 and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy \u2014 Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader. As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren\u2019t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that\u2019s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product. It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it\u2019s no longer defined by its best AI model. Topics Senior AI Reporter Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage \u2014 that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a solar stalker\u201d for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system. Showalter, the CEO ofEG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn\u2019t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it\u2019s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISApublished an advisorydetailing security vulnerabilities in EG4\u2019s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system. For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4\u2019s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they\u2019re learning is that modern solar inverters aren\u2019t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there\u2019s excess power, feeding it back into the grid. Much of this has happened without people noticing. \u201cNobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,\u201d observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about it at the national and international level.\u201d Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations \u2014 primarily residential \u2014 grewmore than fivefoldbetween 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change. Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent. When pressed about his company\u2019s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. \u201cThis is not an EG4 problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an industry-wide problem.\u201d Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor\u2019s inbox, he produced a14-page reportcataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019. Not all of his customers \u2014 some of whomtook to Redditto complain \u2014 are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA\u2019s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures. \u201cThese were fundamental security lapses,\u201d says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. \u201cAdding insult to injury,\u201d continues this individual, \u201cEG4 didn\u2019t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.\u201d Asked why EG4 didn\u2019t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a \u201clive and learn\u201d moment. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so close [to addressing CISA\u2019s concerns] and it\u2019s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the \u2018done\u2019 button, and then advise people, so we\u2019re not in the middle of the cake being baked,\u201d says Showalter. TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that \u201cno known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\u201d While unrelated, the timing of EG4\u2019s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment. Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries.According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers \u2014 components that hadn\u2019t appeared on official hardware lists. This reported discovery carries particular weight given China\u2019s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world\u2019s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some200 GW of European solar power capacityis linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.The geopolitical implications haven\u2019t escaped notice. Lithuania last yearpassed a lawblocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany. But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4\u2019s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company\u2019s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NISTwarnsthat \u201cif you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.\u201d The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations. Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers\u2019 solar inverters, asevidenced by security researchers last year.) The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection standardscurrently applyonly to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms. Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements. But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum. On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes. \u201cWhen you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.\u201d Put another way, the real concern isn\u2019t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity. Showalter has embraced CISA\u2019s intervention as what he calls a \u201ctrust upgrade\u201d \u2014 an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures. But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company\u2019s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they\u2019d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken. Macroeconomic context also weighed on sentiment. Risk assets pulled back following fresh trade policy headlines and hawkish central bank commentary. Futures open interest in DOGE dipped 8%, reflecting lighter speculative positioning despite the month\u2019s whale activity. \u2022 DOGE traded in a wide $0.02 range(8%)between $0.23 lows and $0.25 highs in the 24-hour period from August 24 at 06:00 to August 25 at 05:00.\u2022 The key breakout occurred at 19:00 UTC on August 24, when DOGE spiked to $0.25 on 2.29 billion volume\u2014multiple times the daily average.\u2022 The move quickly reversed, with prices sliding to $0.23 and settling at $0.23 by session close, down 3% from the open.\u2022 In the final hour(04:44\u201305:43), DOGE fell another 0.4% as heavy volume broke through $0.229 intraday support, hitting lows near $0.228 before closing at $0.228. \u2022Resistance: Heavy rejection at $0.25 confirmed strong overhead supply, with 2.29 billion tokens traded at the peak.\u2022Support: Multiple retests anchored support near $0.23, though pressure persisted through late-session deterioration.\u2022Pattern: Range-bound consolidation($0.228\u2013$0.233)suggests buyers defending support but momentum favoring sellers.\u2022Volume: Spikes of 10\u201312 million per minute during the 05:07\u201305:08 window signal institutional distribution.\u2022Indicators: A golden cross remains intact on higher timeframes, but immediate momentum skews bearish without a reclaim of $0.24. \u2022 Whether $0.23 holds as durable support\u2014loss of this level could open downside toward $0.21 psychological zone.\u2022 Follow-through on whale transfers: more Binance inflows could intensify sell pressure, while further accumulation would counterbalance.\u2022 Futures positioning: OI contraction suggests sidelined leverage, but a rebound could fuel the next move.\u2022 Macro backdrop: risk assets remain sensitive to central bank policy; dovish turns could provide relief rallies.\u2022 Broader meme coin flows: correlation with SHIB and PEPE rallies remains a secondary driver of speculative flows into DOGE.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:51.739788", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}

Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:53.251569", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:56.263707", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a \u201cmeaningful shareholder\u201d, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/123afb47-c2ad-4593-b490-e01d0c28af2f", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:57.625195", "sentiment_score": 0.06109999865293503, "symbol": "KDP"}

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

While Intel says the government is making an \u201c$8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock,\u201d the administration does not appear to be committing new funds. Instead, it\u2019s simply making good on what Intel described as \u201cgrants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.\u201d Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billionawarded-but-not-paid to Intelunder the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion alsoawarded by the Biden administrationthrough the Secure Enclave program. Ina post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, \u201cThe United States paid nothing for these shares.\u201d Nonetheless, he described this as \u201ca great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.\u201d Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act,calling it a \u201chorrible, horrible thing\u201dand calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of it. Ina regulatory filingin June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid. According to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests andsaid he should \u201cresign immediately.\u201dThe president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he \u201cnegotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\u201d For his part, Tan said in a statement that the company is \u201cgrateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\u201d Intel\u2019s announcement also says the government\u2019s investment will be \u201cpassive,\u201d with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$111,279.23has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken. Macroeconomic context also weighed on sentiment. Risk assets pulled back following fresh trade policy headlines and hawkish central bank commentary. Futures open interest in DOGE dipped 8%, reflecting lighter speculative positioning despite the month\u2019s whale activity. \u2022 DOGE traded in a wide $0.02 range(8%)between $0.23 lows and $0.25 highs in the 24-hour period from August 24 at 06:00 to August 25 at 05:00.\u2022 The key breakout occurred at 19:00 UTC on August 24, when DOGE spiked to $0.25 on 2.29 billion volume\u2014multiple times the daily average.\u2022 The move quickly reversed, with prices sliding to $0.23 and settling at $0.23 by session close, down 3% from the open.\u2022 In the final hour(04:44\u201305:43), DOGE fell another 0.4% as heavy volume broke through $0.229 intraday support, hitting lows near $0.228 before closing at $0.228. \u2022Resistance: Heavy rejection at $0.25 confirmed strong overhead supply, with 2.29 billion tokens traded at the peak.\u2022Support: Multiple retests anchored support near $0.23, though pressure persisted through late-session deterioration.\u2022Pattern: Range-bound consolidation($0.228\u2013$0.233)suggests buyers defending support but momentum favoring sellers.\u2022Volume: Spikes of 10\u201312 million per minute during the 05:07\u201305:08 window signal institutional distribution.\u2022Indicators: A golden cross remains intact on higher timeframes, but immediate momentum skews bearish without a reclaim of $0.24. \u2022 Whether $0.23 holds as durable support\u2014loss of this level could open downside toward $0.21 psychological zone.\u2022 Follow-through on whale transfers: more Binance inflows could intensify sell pressure, while further accumulation would counterbalance.\u2022 Futures positioning: OI contraction suggests sidelined leverage, but a rebound could fuel the next move.\u2022 Macro backdrop: risk assets remain sensitive to central bank policy; dovish turns could provide relief rallies.\u2022 Broader meme coin flows: correlation with SHIB and PEPE rallies remains a secondary driver of speculative flows into DOGE.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$111,279.23dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:50.739550", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity fundraising slides as sector\u2019s downturn deepens", "content": " Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:52.507223", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest.

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said.

Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/123afb47-c2ad-4593-b490-e01d0c28af2f", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:57.281330", "sentiment_score": 0.06109999865293503, "symbol": "KDP"}

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify. In keeping with a longstanding refusal to screen movies without an exclusive theatrical window, AMC Theatres declined to show this singalong version of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d but it was the only major chain to do so.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday,the company saidit would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.\"The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped,\" he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.\"In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts. This will, by all accounts, increase the capital raising requirement to significantly more than DKK 60 billion,\" Pedersen said.He that the company's Monday announcement to push ahead with its rights issue plans suggested it did not expect the worst-case outcome and was expecting its 60 billion Danish kroner target to be sufficient.\"Orsted's assessment of this is positive - but it is no guarantee that it will end up like this,\" Pedersen said.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/orsted-shares-tumble-as-us-halts-wind-project-construction.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:48:13.525120", "sentiment_score": -0.9398999810218811, "symbol": "TGT"}

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken. Macroeconomic context also weighed on sentiment. Risk assets pulled back following fresh trade policy headlines and hawkish central bank commentary. Futures open interest in DOGE dipped 8%, reflecting lighter speculative positioning despite the month\u2019s whale activity. \u2022 DOGE traded in a wide $0.02 range(8%)between $0.23 lows and $0.25 highs in the 24-hour period from August 24 at 06:00 to August 25 at 05:00.\u2022 The key breakout occurred at 19:00 UTC on August 24, when DOGE spiked to $0.25 on 2.29 billion volume\u2014multiple times the daily average.\u2022 The move quickly reversed, with prices sliding to $0.23 and settling at $0.23 by session close, down 3% from the open.\u2022 In the final hour(04:44\u201305:43), DOGE fell another 0.4% as heavy volume broke through $0.229 intraday support, hitting lows near $0.228 before closing at $0.228. \u2022Resistance: Heavy rejection at $0.25 confirmed strong overhead supply, with 2.29 billion tokens traded at the peak.\u2022Support: Multiple retests anchored support near $0.23, though pressure persisted through late-session deterioration.\u2022Pattern: Range-bound consolidation($0.228\u2013$0.233)suggests buyers defending support but momentum favoring sellers.\u2022Volume: Spikes of 10\u201312 million per minute during the 05:07\u201305:08 window signal institutional distribution.\u2022Indicators: A golden cross remains intact on higher timeframes, but immediate momentum skews bearish without a reclaim of $0.24. \u2022 Whether $0.23 holds as durable support\u2014loss of this level could open downside toward $0.21 psychological zone.\u2022 Follow-through on whale transfers: more Binance inflows could intensify sell pressure, while further accumulation would counterbalance.\u2022 Futures positioning: OI contraction suggests sidelined leverage, but a rebound could fuel the next move.\u2022 Macro backdrop: risk assets remain sensitive to central bank policy; dovish turns could provide relief rallies.\u2022 Broader meme coin flows: correlation with SHIB and PEPE rallies remains a secondary driver of speculative flows into DOGE.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent.

Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:53.251569", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:56.263707", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a \u201cmeaningful shareholder\u201d, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/123afb47-c2ad-4593-b490-e01d0c28af2f", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:57.625195", "sentiment_score": 0.06109999865293503, "symbol": "KDP"}

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify. In keeping with a longstanding refusal to screen movies without an exclusive theatrical window, AMC Theatres declined to show this singalong version of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d but it was the only major chain to do so.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday,the company saidit would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.\"The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped,\" he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.\"In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts. This will, by all accounts, increase the capital raising requirement to significantly more than DKK 60 billion,\" Pedersen said.He that the company's Monday announcement to push ahead with its rights issue plans suggested it did not expect the worst-case outcome and was expecting its 60 billion Danish kroner target to be sufficient.\"Orsted's assessment of this is positive - but it is no guarantee that it will end up like this,\" Pedersen said.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/orsted-shares-tumble-as-us-halts-wind-project-construction.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:23.123356", "sentiment_score": -0.9398999810218811, "symbol": "TGT"}

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$111,279.23has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken. Macroeconomic context also weighed on sentiment. Risk assets pulled back following fresh trade policy headlines and hawkish central bank commentary.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$111,279.23dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:50.739550", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity fundraising slides as sector\u2019s downturn deepens", "content": " Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:52.507223", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:55.865777", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said.

Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify. In keeping with a longstanding refusal to screen movies without an exclusive theatrical window, AMC Theatres declined to show this singalong version of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d but it was the only major chain to do so.

However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

While Intel says the government is making an \u201c$8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock,\u201d the administration does not appear to be committing new funds. Instead, it\u2019s simply making good on what Intel described as \u201cgrants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.\u201d Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billionawarded-but-not-paid to Intelunder the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion alsoawarded by the Biden administrationthrough the Secure Enclave program. Ina post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, \u201cThe United States paid nothing for these shares.\u201d Nonetheless, he described this as \u201ca great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.\u201d Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act,calling it a \u201chorrible, horrible thing\u201dand calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of it. Ina regulatory filingin June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid. According to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests andsaid he should \u201cresign immediately.\u201dThe president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he \u201cnegotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\u201d For his part, Tan said in a statement that the company is \u201cgrateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\u201d Intel\u2019s announcement also says the government\u2019s investment will be \u201cpassive,\u201d with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:01.098233", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity fundraising slides as sector\u2019s downturn deepens", "content": " Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James.

Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:02.517445", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:05.784277", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a \u201cmeaningful shareholder\u201d, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition.

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify. In keeping with a longstanding refusal to screen movies without an exclusive theatrical window, AMC Theatres declined to show this singalong version of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d but it was the only major chain to do so.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

Instead, it\u2019s simply making good on what Intel described as \u201cgrants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.\u201d Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billionawarded-but-not-paid to Intelunder the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion alsoawarded by the Biden administrationthrough the Secure Enclave program. Ina post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, \u201cThe United States paid nothing for these shares.\u201d Nonetheless, he described this as \u201ca great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.\u201d Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act,calling it a \u201chorrible, horrible thing\u201dand calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of it.

According to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests andsaid he should \u201cresign immediately.\u201dThe president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he \u201cnegotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\u201d For his part, Tan said in a statement that the company is \u201cgrateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\u201d Intel\u2019s announcement also says the government\u2019s investment will be \u201cpassive,\u201d with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken. Macroeconomic context also weighed on sentiment. Risk assets pulled back following fresh trade policy headlines and hawkish central bank commentary. Futures open interest in DOGE dipped 8%, reflecting lighter speculative positioning despite the month\u2019s whale activity. \u2022 DOGE traded in a wide $0.02 range(8%)between $0.23 lows and $0.25 highs in the 24-hour period from August 24 at 06:00 to August 25 at 05:00.\u2022 The key breakout occurred at 19:00 UTC on August 24, when DOGE spiked to $0.25 on 2.29 billion volume\u2014multiple times the daily average.\u2022 The move quickly reversed, with prices sliding to $0.23 and settling at $0.23 by session close, down 3% from the open.\u2022 In the final hour(04:44\u201305:43), DOGE fell another 0.4% as heavy volume broke through $0.229 intraday support, hitting lows near $0.228 before closing at $0.228. \u2022Resistance: Heavy rejection at $0.25 confirmed strong overhead supply, with 2.29 billion tokens traded at the peak.\u2022Support: Multiple retests anchored support near $0.23, though pressure persisted through late-session deterioration.\u2022Pattern: Range-bound consolidation($0.228\u2013$0.233)suggests buyers defending support but momentum favoring sellers.\u2022Volume: Spikes of 10\u201312 million per minute during the 05:07\u201305:08 window signal institutional distribution.\u2022Indicators: A golden cross remains intact on higher timeframes, but immediate momentum skews bearish without a reclaim of $0.24. \u2022 Whether $0.23 holds as durable support\u2014loss of this level could open downside toward $0.21 psychological zone.\u2022 Follow-through on whale transfers: more Binance inflows could intensify sell pressure, while further accumulation would counterbalance.\u2022 Futures positioning: OI contraction suggests sidelined leverage, but a rebound could fuel the next move.\u2022 Macro backdrop: risk assets remain sensitive to central bank policy; dovish turns could provide relief rallies.\u2022 Broader meme coin flows: correlation with SHIB and PEPE rallies remains a secondary driver of speculative flows into DOGE.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:51.739788", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity fundraising slides as sector\u2019s downturn deepens", "content": " Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:56.263707", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said.

Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/123afb47-c2ad-4593-b490-e01d0c28af2f", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T11:49:57.625195", "sentiment_score": 0.06109999865293503, "symbol": "KDP"}

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify. In keeping with a longstanding refusal to screen movies without an exclusive theatrical window, AMC Theatres declined to show this singalong version of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d but it was the only major chain to do so.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday,the company saidit would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.\"The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped,\" he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.\"In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$111,279.23has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token\u2019s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August\u2014suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$111,279.23dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:50.739550", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}

Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:52.507223", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:55.865777", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a \u201cmeaningful shareholder\u201d, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/123afb47-c2ad-4593-b490-e01d0c28af2f", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:04:57.281330", "sentiment_score": 0.06109999865293503, "symbol": "KDP"}

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify. In keeping with a longstanding refusal to screen movies without an exclusive theatrical window, AMC Theatres declined to show this singalong version of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d but it was the only major chain to do so.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

While Intel says the government is making an \u201c$8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock,\u201d the administration does not appear to be committing new funds. Instead, it\u2019s simply making good on what Intel described as \u201cgrants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.\u201d Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billionawarded-but-not-paid to Intelunder the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion alsoawarded by the Biden administrationthrough the Secure Enclave program. Ina post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, \u201cThe United States paid nothing for these shares.\u201d Nonetheless, he described this as \u201ca great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.\u201d Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act,calling it a \u201chorrible, horrible thing\u201dand calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of it. Ina regulatory filingin June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid. According to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests andsaid he should \u201cresign immediately.\u201dThe president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he \u201cnegotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\u201d For his part, Tan said in a statement that the company is \u201cgrateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\u201d Intel\u2019s announcement also says the government\u2019s investment will be \u201cpassive,\u201d with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday,the company saidit would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.\"The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped,\" he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.\"In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Japan's Finance Minister Says Crypto Assets Can be Part of Diversified Portfolio", "content": "Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. \"Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,\" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Chalks Out Lower Price High After Powell, Ether Prints Doji at Lifetime Peak", "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news \u2013 such as Powell\u2019s speech \u2013 but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum.\u00a0It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggers $550M in Sunday Liquidations as Ether Rotation Builds", "content": "BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 \u2014 up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. \u201cEthereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,\" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. \"In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally.\" SignalPlus\u2019s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: \u201cETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally.\" Analysts say the rally isn\u2019t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street\u2019s preferred blockchain. \u201cEther\u2019s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Europe is selling its soul to Trump", "content": " Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201ceconomic surrender\u201d and rhetoric that \u201cappears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry\u201d. These are just a small selection of Europeans\u2019 reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump \u2014 first for accepting the US president\u2019s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade \u201cdeal\u201d that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump\u2019s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that \u201cno one is being naive here\u201d. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what\u2019s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine\u2019s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe\u2019s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren\u2019t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents\u2019 own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism \u2014 which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe\u2019s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte\u2019s and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump\u2019s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties \u2014 such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy \u2014 and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the \u201cgrievance doctrine\u201d of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian \u201ctrust the leader\u201d focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump\u2019s will triumph over reality, European leaders\u2019 supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week. If Europe\u2019s other leaders needed to take a cue from the White House, that would have been the right one to follow. martin.sandbu@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/75609ba4-cc61-4556-8ca2-09381da721e9", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:01.098233", "sentiment_score": -0.06499999761581421, "symbol": "COST"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity fundraising slides as sector\u2019s downturn deepens", "content": " Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts\u201d, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts\u201d. The industry\u2019s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE\u2019s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. \u201cThere are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don\u2019t know how else to say it,\u201d said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms\u2019 inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. \u201cAfter three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,\u201d said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. \u201cThe investors really want their money back.\u201d Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump\u2019s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. \u201cThat acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump\u2019s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector\u2019s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about \u20ac17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly \u20ac8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking \u20ac5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about \u20ac4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. \u201cRight now it\u2019s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added.\u00a0\u201cAll the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,\u201d she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. \u201c[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,\u201d Joseph at Rede Partners said. \u201cThe biggest thing that they\u2019re really looking at is [whether] this manager\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[is] fit for the future.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7387912-1079-43d4-a9a2-2308989400d4", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:02.517445", "sentiment_score": -0.9642999768257141, "symbol": "TGT"}

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. \u201cThe uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,\u201d said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.\u201d Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: \u201cI\u2019ve got one British expat client who\u2019s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.\u201d Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cIf you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.\u201d \u201cNon-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn\u2019t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,\u201d he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE\u2019s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. \u201cOne said they\u2019ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s got a lot busier,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between \u00a34mn and \u00a36.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby\u2019s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested \u00a3245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just \u00a325mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: \u201cThe UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.\u201d Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4a5b93e4-a11b-4eea-960a-7423903c1663", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:05.784277", "sentiment_score": -0.9351000189781189, "symbol": "WELL"}

Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet\u2019s for roughly \u20ac16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group\u2019s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet\u2019s shareholders \u20ac31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company\u2019s equity at \u20ac15.7bn. JDE Peet\u2019s owns more than 50 brands, including caf\u00e9 chain Peet\u2019s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet\u2019s had closed at \u20ac26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create \u201ctwo winning companies, including a new global coffee champion\u201d, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet\u2019s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal \u201cdelivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities\u201d, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a \u201cmeaningful shareholder\u201d, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/123afb47-c2ad-4593-b490-e01d0c28af2f", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:10:07.462157", "sentiment_score": 0.06109999865293503, "symbol": "KDP"}

And that\u2019s despite only being in theaters for two-thirds of the weekend (namely, Saturday and Sunday). This isn\u2019t the first time a streaming title has topped the box office charts. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u201cF1\u201d (distributed in U.S. theaters by Warner Bros.) opened toan even more impressive $57 millionearlier this summer. But this marks the first time Netflix has had the biggest movie in theaters. The victory comes with some asterisks, most notably that Netflix doesn\u2019t announce box office returns itself. So these aren\u2019t official numbers from the streamer, but ratherpreliminary weekend estimates from other industry sources. This was, admittedly, a quiet weekend, without major new releases. Besides \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the top-grossing movie was \u201cWeapons,\u201d which made an estimated $15.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, for a $115 million domestic total. Still, this feels like a milestone for a company that has avoided traditional theatrical releases (a stance that may havedriven away some of its most successful filmmakers). The closest it\u2019s come is a one-week release of Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequel \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d which earnedan estimated $15 million in theaters. And then there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cNarnia\u201d adaptation, which will probably do even bigger box office numbers when itlaunches exclusively on Imax screensnext fall. This is also an impressive victory for a movie that\u2019s been available on streaming since late June, and has already climbed to the number two spot onNetflix\u2019s chart of all-time most-watched movies, with more than 210 million views. (It\u2019s sandwiched, somehow, between \u201cRed Notice\u201d and \u201cCarry-On\u201d). Produced by Sony Pictures Animation and with a largely Korean/Korean American voice cast, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d tells the story of a K-Pop girl group that, yes, also hunts demons, including a rival boy band. \u201cGolden,\u201d a song from the film\u2019s soundtrack,topped the Billboard chartsand has been streamed more than 400 million times on Spotify.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that this will bethe first of three planned yearsof major iPhone redesigns, witha foldable iPhonecoming in 2026. The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsfpic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest.Conceptual renderingsshow that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons. Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win. According toleaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially includedark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, arecent leakindicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options. While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event,a leakshowed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap. The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever,the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. This move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way forApple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on therenderswe\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are alsorumorsthat there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top. Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature alarger display. One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman, the companymay need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that aredesigned blood oxygen featureis rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver.Rumorssuggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

Instead, it\u2019s simply making good on what Intel described as \u201cgrants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.\u201d Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billionawarded-but-not-paid to Intelunder the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion alsoawarded by the Biden administrationthrough the Secure Enclave program. Ina post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, \u201cThe United States paid nothing for these shares.\u201d Nonetheless, he described this as \u201ca great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.\u201d Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act,calling it a \u201chorrible, horrible thing\u201dand calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of it. Ina regulatory filingin June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid. According to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests andsaid he should \u201cresign immediately.\u201dThe president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he \u201cnegotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\u201d For his part, Tan said in a statement that the company is \u201cgrateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\u201d Intel\u2019s announcement also says the government\u2019s investment will be \u201cpassive,\u201d with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

In ablog postpublished on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn\u2019t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law\u2019s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi\u2019sHB 1126requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justicesdecided to blockanemergency appealthat would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification ofallusers. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user\u2019s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too \u2014 up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \u201csignificant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\u201d To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it\u2019s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi\u2019s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. \u201cUnlike tech giants with vast resources, we\u2019re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read. \u201cAge verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring \u2014 costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,\u201d it noted. Some Bluesky users outside Mississippi subsequentlyreported issues accessing the servicedue to their cell providers routing traffic through servers in the state, withCTO Paul Frazee respondingSaturday that the company was \u201cworking deploy an update to our location detection that we hope will solve some inaccuracies.\u201d The company\u2019s blog post notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently. This post has been updated to reflect user issues outside Mississippi and Bluesky\u2019s response.

Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon posted record profit in the first half of the year underscoring how local challengers toNvidiaare gaining traction as Beijing looks to boost its domestic industry.Cambricon is among a plethora of companies in Chinathat are vying to be an alternative to American giant Nvidia when it comes to providing the chips required to train and run artificial intelligence applications and models.In the first half of the year, Cambricon said revenue surged more than 4,000% year-on-year to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million) and net profit hit a record 1.04 billion yuan. The numbers remain small when compared to Nvidia whichreported $44 billion of revenuein its February to April quarter. The tech giant is due to report itsfiscal second-quarter earningslater today.Still, Cambricon's surge in revenue highlights how tech companies in China are searching for potential alternatives to Nvidia, given the continuous threat that they could be cut off from American technology.Nvidia wasblocked earlier this yearfrom selling its pared back H20 chip to China. It has since been allowed to resume exports to China but must share15% of its revenuefrom sales to the country with the U.S government.Meanwhile, China hasreportedly been discouraginglocal firms to buy Nvidia's H20 chips.

The total value of the company is around $80 billion.Nvidia's strength has not only been in its hardware but also in its software which developers have become accustomed to using. Cambricon said Wednesday that it too is improving its software offering and is working on next-generation hardware.Nevertheless, China's Nvidia rivals face many obstacles when it comes to beating the competition.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Denmark summons top US diplomat over alleged covert operations in Greenland", "content": " Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent PublishedAugust 27 2025 UpdatedAugust 27 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Denmark has summoned the top US diplomat in the country over reports that American citizens with alleged links to President Donald Trump have been conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, said on Wednesday that there were \u201cforeign actors\u201d attempting to influence the future ofGreenlandand that all such efforts were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He has summoned Mark Stroh, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the US embassy in Copenhagen and its most senior diplomat inDenmarkat present, for a meeting at the foreign ministry. Denmark has been shaken by Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that the US wants totake control of the vast Arctic island\u2014 a semi-autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark \u2014 from Copenhagen, and his refusal to rule out using force to do so. The Scandinavian country had already summoned the top US diplomat in May, following a report in the Wall Street Journal that a classified message wassent to American intelligence agenciesurging them to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who support Trump\u2019s ambition to take over the island. The latest report by DR, the Danish public broadcaster, said Danish authorities were aware of at least three US citizens with alleged links to the Trump administration gathering information in Greenland and conducting influence operations. Rasmussen said in television interviews that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the report. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we gain some insight into this so that our people \u2014 in both Greenland and Denmark \u2014 know what it is that we risk being up against.\u201d Denmark\u2019s security and intelligence service (PET) said on Wednesday that its assessment was that \u201cGreenland, especially in the current situation, is the target of influence campaigns of various kinds. PET expects that such campaigns have the purpose of creating a split in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.\u201d Some senior Danish officials sought to downplay the significance of summoning Stroh, saying that the three US citizens appeared to act in an amateur way and there was no link established to US intelligence. Recommended But Danish politicians reacted with dismay. \u201cThis means the whole misery over Greenland is not over,\u201d former foreign minister Martin Lidegaard told the TV channel TV2. He added: \u201cThis is putting a heavy strain on our relationship with the US \u2014 and Americans should know that too.\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark\u2019s parliament, said: \u201cIt is beyond a joke that they try to infiltrate Greenland\u2019s society in this way. It is Greenland itself who must decide what we want and what future we want.\u201d The allegations come just days after the Trump administration caused pain to Danish business by issuing a stop-work order on an almost complete offshore wind farm co-owned by \u00d8rsted. That came on the same day that Rasmussen and Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the US signed a partnership with California\u2019s Governor Gavin Newsom, the self-styled leader of the resistance to Trump. Danish officials deny there is a connection between the two events. The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0The US is currently without an ambassador in Copenhagen despite Trump naming Ken Howery, who is close to Elon Musk, in December. In a separate move, Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Wednesday apologised to the thousands of Greenlandic women who over decades were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils. She acknowledged that the case had caused \u201canger and sorrow\u201d in Greenland as well as hurting perceptions of Denmark. \u201cWe cannot change what has happened. But we can take responsibility. Therefore, on behalf of Denmark, I would like to say: sorry.\u201d Many Greenlanders use this issue to express why they want to gain independence from Denmark, but surveys suggest the 57,000 on the Arctic island are reluctant to do so imminently for fear of losing out economically.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c067d901-7acf-4b5b-8aa7-5673a2891b71", "timestamp": "2025-08-27T12:43:58.143352", "sentiment_score": -0.8738999962806702, "symbol": "TGT"}

The agent, Claude for Chrome, is rolling out to a group of 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic\u2019s Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month. The company is also opening awaitlistfor other interested users. By adding an extension to Chrome, select users can now chat with Claude in a sidecar window that maintains context of everything happening in their browser. Users can also give the Claude agent permission to take actions in their browser and complete some tasks on their behalf. The browser is quickly becoming the next battleground for AI labs, which aim to use browser integrations to offer more seamless connections between AI systems and their users. Perplexity recently launched its own browser,Comet, which features an AI agent that can offload tasks for users. OpenAI is reportedly close to launching its ownAI-powered browser, which is rumored to have similar features to Comet. Meanwhile, Google has launched Gemini integrations withChromein recent months. The race to develop AI-powered browsers is especially pressing given Google\u2019s looming antitrust case, in which a final decision is expected any day now. The federal judge in the case has suggested he may force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Perplexity submitted anunsolicited $34.5 billion offer for Chrome, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested his company would bewilling to buy itas well. In the Tuesday blog post, Anthropic warned that the rise of AI agents with browser access poses new safety risks. Last week, Brave\u2019s security team said it found that Comet\u2019s browser agent could be vulnerable toindirect prompt-injection attacks, where hidden code on a website could trick the agent into executing malicious instructions when it processed the page. (Perplexity\u2019s head of communications, Jesse Dwyer, told TechCrunch in an email that the vulnerability Brave raised has been fixed.) Anthropic says it hopes to use this research preview as a chance to catch and address novel safety risks; however, the company has already introduced several defenses against prompt injection attacks. The company says its interventions reduced the success rate of prompt injection attacks from 23.6% to 11.2%. For example, Anthropic says users can limit Claude\u2019s browser agent from accessing certain sites in the app\u2019s settings, and the company has, by default, blocked Claude from accessing websites that offer financial services, adult content, and pirated content. The company also says that Claude\u2019s browser agent will ask for user permission before \u201ctaking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.\u201d This isn\u2019t Anthropic\u2019s first foray into AI models that can control your computer screen. In October 2024, the company launched an AI agent that couldcontrol your PC\u2014 however, testing at the time revealed that the model was quite slow and unreliable. The capabilities of agentic AI models have improved quite a bit since then. TechCrunch has found that modern browser-using AI agents, such as Comet andChatGPT Agent, are fairly reliable at offloading simple tasks for users. However, many of these agentic systems still struggle with more complex problems. Topics Senior AI Reporter Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Even Intel is unconvinced. Intel Foundry, which manufactures custom semiconductors for outside customers, has not been fruitful for the company. The business division lost out on potential big contracts, like one with Sony,according to Reuters, and has cost the company significantly more than it has brought in. Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of$3.1 billionin the second quarter. The company has also laid off thousands of people since the beginning of the year, with thefoundry business unit being hit especially hard. Differences over how Intel would turn around itsstruggling foundry businesswas partially responsible for Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s resignation from the company board in August 2024. Tan wasappointed CEOin spring 2025. Kevin Cassidy, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, told TechCrunch he doesn\u2019t see how this deal will solve Intel\u2019s problems. Intel Foundry doesn\u2019t need money to solve its issues, he said, instead it needs to change its approach to its customers. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand customer service,\u201d Cassidy said of Intel Foundry\u2019s struggles to sign customers. \u201cThey have always manufactured internally, the manufacturing group was king. It\u2019s hard to be a customer service-focused group when you think you know better.\u201d Intel did not respond to a request for comment. Intel recently acknowledged the potential downsides of this deal inan SEC filingposted Monday. The company highlighted the risks it carries for its investors and customers \u2014\u00a0two groups of people Intel naturally relies on. This deal dilutes existing shareholders and reduces their governance rights. The Trump administration said it would vote alongside Intel\u2019s interests, which could help the company move its ideas forward; but business decisions that actively sour an existing investor base conflicts with efforts to drum up investor interest. \u201cI would be disappointed if I was a stockholder,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIntel gave up another 430 million shares, and diluted my shares, and [they] were able to buy it at a 20% discount.\u201d Intel also mentioned the potential impact this could have on its international business. The vast majority of the company\u2019s revenue in its last fiscal year, 76%, came from outside the U.S., the company reported. Amid the current U.S.-led international trade turmoil, companies outside the United States will now have to grapple with whether or not to work with a company partially owned by the U.S. government. Not everyone is doom and gloom about the recent transaction. Cody Acree, managing director and senior research analyst at Benchmark Company, told TechCrunch he doesn\u2019t see the company\u2019s international customers shying away from Intel. Acree said the deal isn\u2019t perfect, but the government\u2019s commitment to Intel\u2019s future may give the chipmaker the boost it needs \u2014\u00a0even if it\u2019s just a small step on a long road to recovery. \u201cIntel has shown that it\u2019s been struggling for the last decade and may need some kind of government intervention; a bail out is probably too harsh of a term, but the government intervention is being seen as at least a stepping stone toward reinvigorating Intel,\u201d Acree said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with it being a fix-all by any means. It\u2019s at least encouraging to know that the government is backing Intel instead of challenging the leadership as they were a month ago.\u201d Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, agreed that a deal with the U.S. government could be positive. In an interview before the deal was formally announced, Rocco said that this could give Intel a bigger role in the administration\u2019s current push for domestic AI prowess through initiatives like OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle\u2019sStargate initiativeand bringing semiconductor manufacturing stateside. \u201cThe market is going to be so big, the data center and chip market, even if they get a small slice,\u201d Rocco said. \u201cThere is room for them to succeed. This will be a positive. You have to have a five-to-10-year time horizon.\u201d Still, both analysts cautioned the deal won\u2019t be Intel\u2019s savior. For a true, long-standing rescue, Intel needs to look inward. While the Trump administration claims it will be a passive investor, that doesn\u2019t mean its involvement can\u2019t drum up business for the company, Acree said. While that hopefully wouldn\u2019t come from pressure or force, Cassidy said, it definitely could. Even though the government might not have to. Unlike higher education, corporate America has proven itself more than happy to lean toward the Trump administration\u2019s goals and policies. Companies havegutted their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs\u2014despite hurting themselves in the process. A prevalence of pro-America sentiment has become saturated inadvertisementsandcompany communicationsince Donald Trump took office in January. If the Trump administration tells American companies to buy Intel\u2019s chips and hardware, they might not have to do as much convincing to get companies on board. Acree and Cassidy said the real test for Intel won\u2019t be the deal, or even the optics of it. It will be whether Intel can drum up interest for its 14A chipmaking processor. Tan has said the companywould not start production on its 14A chipmaking processuntil they secured substantial customer interest. \u201cThere is still no guarantee that Intel is going to be able to come back into the market at the leading edge,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIntel has been burning cash for quite a few years, I don\u2019t know if it is just more money to buy time to find the formula to get them back on the leading edge.\u201d Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The \u201cNo Azure for Apartheid\u201d group livestreamed their sit-in on Twitch, hoisting banners, chanting \u2018Brad Smith, you can\u2019t hide, you\u2019re supporting genocide!\u2019 and posting a mock legal summons charging Smith with \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d Microsoft did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment earlier in the day, but a few hours after the occupation, Smith held a hastily called press conference beside his desk to address the extraordinary events. Of the seven people involved, he said, just two were current Microsoft employees and one was a former Google employee, Smith said. He also told reporters gathered on the scene \u2014including from GeekWire\u2014 that after the protesters refused to leave when asked, Redmond police had to physically remove them from the building. Police arrested all seven on charges including trespassing and obstruction. Smith said the protesters\u2019 actions were \u201cnot necessary in order to get us to pay attention\u201d and that such activity \u201cdistracts from the real dialogue\u201d that Microsoft is having with employee groups of different backgrounds, faiths, and cultures inside Microsoft. According to a report earlier in the day byThe Verge, the protest included both active Microsoft workers and former employees who\u2019d been fired for previous activism. Monday\u2019s escalation follows months of protests over Microsoft\u2019s cloud contracts with Israel, including recent arrests at company headquarters. A recentGuardian investigationrevealed Israel uses Microsoft\u2019s services to store data from millions of calls each day made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Monday\u2019s corporate takeover mirrored tactics from Google employees more than a year ago. In April 2024, nine Google workers staged coordinated protests across New York and California offices, with five occupying Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian\u2019s office for nine hours. They wrote demands on his whiteboard and wore \u201cGoogler against genocide\u201d shirts. The Google protesters targeted Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract with Amazon that provides Israel\u2019s government and military with cloud computing and AI tools. The employees\u2019 sit-ins and arrests were similarly livestreamed on Twitch; three days later, 28 employees involved in those protests werefired. Update: This story was updated to reflect Smith\u2019s comments, which were made hours after the protesters in his office were removedbut after this piece was first published.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "DOGE uploaded live copy of Social Security database to \u2018vulnerable\u2019 cloud server, says whistleblower", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A top Social Security Administration official turned whistleblower says members of the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to a vulnerable cloud server, putting the personal information of most Americans at risk of compromise. Charles Borges, the Social Security Administration\u2019s chief data officer, said ina newly released whistleblower complaint published Tuesdaythat other top agency officials signed off on a decision in June to upload \u201ca live copy of the country\u2019s Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight,\u201d despite Borges raising concerns. The database, known as the Numerical Identification System, contains more than 450 million records containing all of the data submitted as part of a Social Security application, including the applicant\u2019s name, place of birth, citizenship, and the Social Security numbers of their family members, as well as other sensitive personal and financial information. Borges said members of DOGE, theteam of former Elon Musk employees appointed to government under the guise of reducing fraud and waste, copied the sensitive database to an agency-run Amazon-hosted cloud server \u201capparently lacking in independent security controls,\u201d such as who was accessing the data and how they were using it. The lack of security protections violated internal agency security controls and federal privacy laws, the complaint alleges. Borges said by allowing DOGE to be administrators of the agency\u2019s cloud, the DOGE operatives would be able to create \u201cpublicly accessible services,\u201d meaning that they could allow public access to the cloud system and any of the sensitive data stored inside. Borges warned in the complaint that if this information were compromised, \u201cit is possible that the sensitive [personally identifiable information] on every American including health diagnoses, income levels and banking information, family relationships, and personal biographic data could be exposed publicly, and shared widely.\u201d The complaint said any compromise or unauthorized access to the database would have \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d on the U.S. Social Security program, describing a worst-case scenario as potentially having to reissue everyone\u2019s Social Security numbers. While a federal restraining order in Marchinitially blocked DOGE staffersfrom accessing the country\u2019s database of Social Security records, the Supreme Court lifted the order on June 6, paving the way for DOGE\u2019s access. In the days that followed, DOGE allegedly worked to seek internal approvals from the agency\u2019s top brass, per Borges\u2019 complaint. The agency\u2019s chief information officerAram Moghaddassiapproved the move to copy the database to the agency\u2019s cloud, saying he \u201cdetermined the business need is higher than the security risk\u201d and that he accepts \u201call risks\u201d with the project. The complaint also saysMichael Russo, a senior DOGE operative who previously served as the agency\u2019s chief information officer prior to Moghaddassi but remains at the agency, also approved moving live Social Security data to the cloud. Borges said he first raised issues internally at the agency but later blew the whistle to urge members of Congress to \u201cengage in immediate oversight to address these serious concerns,\u201d according toa statementby his attorney, Andrea Meza, at the Government Accountability Project. This is the latest accusation of poor cybersecurity practices by the administration and its representatives,including DOGE, since President Trump took office earlier in January. Since January, members of DOGE have takensweeping control of most U.S. federal departmentsand their datasets of citizens\u2019 data. When reached by TechCrunch, Elizabeth Huston, a spokesperson for the White House, would not say if the administration was aware of the complaint and deferred comment to the Social Security Administration. In an emailed response, Social Security Administration spokesperson Nick Perrine said the agency \u201cstores personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information.\u201d \u201cThe data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA\u2019s Information Security team,\u201d the spokesperson added. The spokesperson said the agency was \u201cnot aware of any compromise to this environment.\u201d Data breaches involving federal government data stored in the cloud are rare but not unheard of. In 2023, TechCrunch reported that theU.S. Department of Defense publicly exposed thousands of sensitive military emailsonline due to a security lapse. While the email data was stored in Microsoft Azure\u2019s separate cloud dedicated for government customers, a misconfigurationallowed the contents of a military unit\u2019s emailsto publicly spill online. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated where the DOD\u2019s exposed email was hosted. The story now accurately reflects that the exposed data was hosted on Microsoft\u2019s Azure.

The money will be used to continue developing its AI, as well as to penetrate deeper into Southeast Asia and the Middle East and make inroads into Europe.The startup\u2019s fundraise and plans for growth underscore the rapid rise of social commerce \u2014 where sellers leverage platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok and YouTube to market their goods and find new customers, and consumers use the same social media platforms to discover and buy things.Social commerce is currently growing faster thanconventional e-commerce. The estimated market value of social commerce in the Asia Pacific region alone is expectedto exceed $894 million by 2028, representing a 10.6% growth from 2022.Within that, conversational AI is a big part of how social commerce has developed. Using AI-based chat functionality means sellers can scale their customer service to work with masses of users while still keeping their own operations lean. It also adds a programmatic layer to the process, with analytics giving them more insight into what works, and what does not, and when and to whom, and to automate different kinds of responses to different audiences accordingly.The conversational AI industry is projected to reach$49.9 billion by 2030, up 24.9% from $13.2 billion in 2024.Given the scaling imperative of not just social commerce but e-commerce overall, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising to hear that the conversational AI space is a crowded one. SleekFlow\u2019s competitors includeMessageBird,Respond.io,Gupshup,Omnichat, Trengo,WATI,Unifonicand Verloop.Henson Tsai, the founder and CEO of SleekFlow, says that the startup sets itself apart from these and other rivals by way of more streamlined features. Those features include omnichannel capabilities (i.e., marketing to more than one platform and interface from a single dashboard), marketing automation, and a user-friendly flow builder that enables flexibility in creating unique chat experiences for each customer. Instant checkout capabilities include in-chat payment links, collaborative team features, built-in CRM platform integrations with HubSpot and Salesforce, and e-commerce functionality.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

{"source": "TechCrunch_Historical", "title": "Google\u2019s Nest Learning Thermostat is still the one to beat", "content": "A refurbishedthird-generation Nest Learning Thermostatwas one of the first things I picked up upon moving into my first house last month. As a longtime New York City apartment dweller, I\u2019d largely observed the device from afar, wondering how a thermostat of all things became foundational to Google\u2019s hardware play.My timing could have been better, of course, with thefourth-gen devicejust now launching. But as a financial adviser told me before I settled on this place, \u201cthe best time to buy a house is last year.\u201d If you sit and wait for the perfect moment, you\u2019ll be sitting and waiting forever.During this especially brutal summer, I\u2019ve come to appreciate a lot about the Nest \u2014 though buying one used on eBay wasn\u2019t the smartest, as the thing could never stay connected to Wi-Fi. Aside from access to central air, the greatest thing that the installation afforded me is confidence.Live in an apartment long enough, and you\u2019ll begin to doubt yourself when it comes to even the simplest tasks. On one particularly sweltering mid-July afternoon, however, I flipped off the house\u2019s power, removed the ancient digital thermostat and wired up the Nest. The only thing more surprising than me not putting myself in the hospital was the fact that it worked (Wi-Fi glitches aside).After the thermostat, I undertook a few other small wiring tasks and \u2014 as you can probably guess reading this \u2014 did not kill myself. When the new Nest arrived at my front door, I unboxed it and had it up and running in a few minutes. Again, still alive. Your mileage will vary, of course, depending on several factors, including your HVAC system\u2019s compatibility.For me, it was as simple as cutting off power, popping off the old face, disconnecting the wires, swapping out wall plates and popping the new model in. The Google Home app walks you through the relevant steps. After connecting to your house Wi-Fi (it worked this time, thankfully), it\u2019s ready to go.Image Credits:Brian HeaterThe fourth-gen model does have one extra step, as it ships with a second sensor. The pebble-shaped accessory can be placed on a flat surface or attached to the wall anywhere in the house away from the thermostat. The more you add, the better idea the Nest has of overall temperature. It\u2019s a nice in-box addition, and you can always add more as needed. My place is small, so I should be good with the one.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This, coupled with the device\u2019s onboard sensor and any other secondary sensors, informs the system\u2019s goal of achieving the user\u2019s preferences without wasting electricity. Google gives the following examples: \u201cIf it\u2019s a sunny winter day and your home gets warmer on its own, it will pause heating. Or, on a humid day, the indoor temperature may feel warmer than intended, so the thermostat will adjust accordingly.\u201dThat\u2019s essentially the heart of the Nest Learning Thermostat. The system utilizes AI to analyze the data it collects. From there, it follows your patterns and adjusts to fall within your temperature comfort spectrum \u2014 hence the \u201cLearning\u201d part of the name. It\u2019s impossible to give the Nest a full review at this early stage, as proof of efficacy is only borne out over time.Beyond ease of installation and use, one thing I absolutelycansay right out of the box is that \u2014 much like its predecessors \u2014 it\u2019s a great-looking piece of hardware. I suspect that prior to the first Nest Thermostat\u2019s arrival in 2011, few homes gave much thought to how their thermostats looked. It\u2019s not a coincidence that two of Nest\u2019s founders came from Apple. The startup effectively made the iPod of thermostats, right down to the scrolling navigation.Image Credits:Brian HeaterThe new model\u2019s 2.7-inch display is 60% larger than its predecessor\u2019s, now stretching edge to edge. In fact, the screen is larger than the base, creating a kind of mushroom shape when viewed from the side. Google gets more use out of the new curved display, utilizing a proximity sensor to note when someone is in the area and displaying a range of different faces, including different clocks, the weather or just your standard thermostat info.The thermostat is the first thing one sees upon entering my new house. It\u2019s right there on the opposite wall and, for better or worse, it immediately draws the eye. It\u2019s a good spot for a display that showcases additional information. It\u2019s not a smart display by any means, but the additional info is a nice touch for anyone passing by who isn\u2019t obsessed with the indoor temperature.The Nest Learning Thermostat remains a beautiful piece of industrial design, with some fresh twists that help it more seamlessly blend in with other smart home devices and the home in general. Speaking of twists, the company has maintained the rotating interface, with the tactile clicks that drew many to the line in the first place.Image Credits:Brian HeaterGoogle is hoping to reinvigorate its smart home offerings for the age of generative AI-powered assistants, so it might as well have returned to the device that started it all. The fourth-generation thermostat perhaps isn\u2019t exactly the sort of top-down reinvention one might have hoped for after nine years between devices. But then, despite an influx of competition in the smart thermostat segment, the previous model continued to hold its own.It\u2019s a $280 device, which is admittedly a big investment for a product few thought much about a decade ago. But it won\u2019t be coming off my wall anytime soon.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/20/googles-nest-learning-thermostat-is-still-the-one-to-beat/", "timestamp": "2024-08-20T00:00:00", "scraped_at": "2025-08-27T12:46:00.898774", "sentiment_score": 0.014800000004470348, "symbol": "GOOGL"}

Earlier this month, Apple announced it wouldallow third-party developers to access new NFC(near-field communications) and Secure Element APIs, which today power contactless transactions and payments \u2014 like those enabled by Apple Wallet. Though PayPal has not yet explicitly confirmed it will now develop a competing wallet thanks to these new APIs, the company has broadly hinted in recent weeks that such a plan is in the works.During the payment giant\u2019s July 30 second-quarter earnings call with investors, PayPal CEO Alex Chriss responded to an inquiry about PayPal\u2019s European strategy by noting that with \u201csome of the changes coming particularly in Europe around NFC,\u201d that would open opportunity for PayPal and allow it to \u201cbe prepared shortly to be able to play in that space.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time Chriss had teased a mobile wallet, either.

An offline solution, in this case, likely refers to the plan to offer NFC-based transactions through a PayPal mobile app.In the EU, consumerswill be able toset a third-party wallet as their default, instead of Apple Wallet, as part of Apple\u2019s compliance with the EU\u2019s new regulation, theDigital Markets Act(DMA). This legislation creates additional opportunities for app developers, including those related to how they can distribute apps outside the App Store,use alternative browser enginesand request interoperability with hardware and software features on iOS, like the Secure Element that\u2019s involved in NFC transactions on iPhone.To finally be able to offer a fully functional mobile wallet would be a major win for PayPal, given that the company for a long time has attempted to establish itself in the world of offline retail. Over the years, PayPal pursued a range of opportunities,including partnerships with national retailersin the U.S.;deals with point-of-sale software and terminal makers;features to pay local shops via its app;acquisitions of mobile wallet technology;\u00a0theuse of QR codes for retailer payments;partnerships with credit cards on offline payments; andtools for merchants selling offline, among others.

After raising $172 million from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins, the news came as a bit of a shock to the fintech community. We don\u2019t really know what exactly led to Tally\u2019s demise, although some speculate it was in part due to high interest rates, but it\u2019s sad news no matter what the cause.

{"source": "TechCrunch_Historical", "title": "How Fabric plans to make advanced cryptography ubiquitous", "content": "Fabric Cryptography, a hardware startup by MIT and Stanford dropouts (and married couple)Michael Gaoand Tina Ju, wants to make modern cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proof (which lets you prove things without giving up exactly what you know) and fully homomorphic encryption (which enables you to work with encrypted data without decrypting it) ubiquitous. This, the co-founders argue, will ease what they see as a fundamental tension between trust and privacy in an age where companies gather increasing amounts of data about consumers, yet are also increasingly unable to safeguard this data.To prove this out, the team has developed a custom RISC-V-based chip that is optimized to run the algorithms necessary to establish zero-knowledge proofs and enable fully homomorphic encryption. Fabric calls this a \u201cverifiable processing unit\u201d (VPU). Existing hardware, the team says, is simply too slow to make things like fully homomorphic encryption ubiquitous, so it takes custom chips to make this happen.A number of VCs are now also backing its idea, with Blockchain Capital and 1kx leading the company\u2019s $33 million Series A round. Offchain Labs, Polygon and Matter Labs also participated.\u00a0It follows a $6 million seed round led by Metaplanet with participation from the likes of Inflection and Liquid2 Ventures.Image Credits:FabricThe fact that there are several crypto investors here investing in cryptography is no coincidence. \u201cWe could not be more thrilled to partner with Fabric on their mission to accelerate all cryptographic operations with the world\u2019s first VPU to help bring about a world where privacy and verifiability are non-negotiable components of all digital systems,\u201d said Yuan Han Li, an investor at Blockchain Capital.While Fabric has its sights set on enterprises, the market with the most immediate need for its solution is the blockchain space, which is also why its first-generation chip will focus on zero-knowledge proofs.\u201cWith zero-knowledge proofs and fully homomorphic encryption, it\u2019s really starting to look like AI in the 2010s, with exponentially increasing compute demand,\u201d Gao told me. \u201cYou can tell that although not everyone understands what it is, it\u2019s increasing in ubiquity already within the crypto space. And we think that it goes beyond crypto. It goes to pervasive cryptography in the enterprise. And so we realized that this is really a mainstream moment, and hardware could be the final accelerant that pushes it over the edge and allows cryptographers to make their dreams come true. That\u2019s why Tina and I teamed up and started this company.\u201dFabric says it already received \u201ctens of millions of dollars in preorders.\u201dTechcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The London Fund is a U.K. venture firm with \u201cover $1 billion in cash and assets\u201d in AUM that is leading a proposed $450 million raise for Bolt, a one-click checkout startup that has been embroiled in a number of controversies over the years.But all that isn\u2019t deterring Shah, who describes theterm sheet that is in play for Boltas \u201ca fabulous transaction about a company that we believe has a lot more room left in it.\u201dI interviewed Shah on Wednesday afternoon about the deal and its eyebrow-raising terms. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.TC: What are you able to say about this proposed transaction?Shah: The London Fund has been around since 2003. We are always looking for Ferraris with flat tires. Sometimes people don\u2019t understand why. Maybe it\u2019s not the right color. Maybe it\u2019s not what the market knows. We\u2019re deeply technical. I\u2019m a multi-time founder, and have gone through a lot of this. We really at the end of the day saw something here that is quite special. Bolt has an unbelievable reach \u2014 if you look at the number of wallets and people that have used the system, how it works, and if you compare them to like a Shopify, or to some of the other bigger players, they\u2019re on par. I think that\u2019s a hidden gem.If you look at the ability over time, if you launch the Super App, the ability to have interactions between wallet holders. When you start looking at Shopify or Bolt, and you start realizing that the user base is massive, and you have a big opportunity.Obviously, this is a term sheet \u2014 it\u2019s not yet final.

We\u2019ve worked very hard on this. There\u2019s been six months of thinking and working and tracking. We believe that what we bring to the table as a firm and what Bolt has can lead to some amazing new activity. I think there\u2019s a lot of value for all the shareholders. I think a lot of folks have got it quite wrong. We\u2019re simply asking that existing shareholders show that they\u2019re committed to the future of what this journey looks like. Right? We\u2019re not saying anything negative, but I\u2019m sort of saying, if I\u2019m putting my skin in the game, then I want others to make sure that they\u2019re there. And I think, assuming all goes well, then hopefully this transaction concludes quite well, and we\u2019ve left it open so others can come in with capital as well. We\u2019re simply leading on this. There\u2019s plenty of room.As part of the proposed transaction, your firm would be contributing $250 million. What are some examples of marketing services that you are offering as part of your $250 million investment in lieu of cash?We provide tactical capital. We want to make sure that what we\u2019re deploying has a very real impact in a firm that we give it to. When it comes to marketing credits, we get to decide how that looks like. Essentially, it has to be the cash equivalent\u2026.We believe that over time, a lot of the kind of resources that funds will provide don\u2019t have to take the intermediate step of cash.One of our funds actually has influencers and media as our LPs. So we\u2019re offering visibility, just like Warner Brothers would offer television time \u2014 except ours are influencers and people who are able to speak about services or products or things like that. So if you look at Bolt, they spend a lot of money on co-marketing dollars, like they spend about $80 million in marketing already, and they use that to co-market. So we can provide the co-marketing funds that they need and the co-marketing impressions that their brands need.Think of it like a barter, like OpenAI did that with Microsoft, right? Ten billion. It was compute on Azure. They just said it was a ten billion dollar investment. But the reality: it\u2019s also a way for Microsoft to manage and watch exactly how they\u2019re performing.For us, we like to have full alignment between our LPs all the way to the company. I don\u2019t take a 2% fee. So I think the other important thing is we are very aligned with our investments. We only do well if there\u2019s an exit, which is a big thing.On our side, we tend to believe that if we can go into companies that fundamentally have core assets, like in this case, wallets and transactions and users, you could do some really great things with it.What is your opinion on Ryan Breslow returning as CEO?I think it\u2019s important. I mean, the guy came up with it. The guy had foresight to figure out how to do a system where you can get into so many different retailers and help them in a way that is also helpful for the consumer. That\u2019s no small feat. I mean, compare it to Revolut, compare it to Shopify \u2014 look at the speed at which he was able to grow. I think that there are ways to make sure that this business can keep growing. I think you need to have the vision behind it. There\u2019s a couple more stages to this. Ryan\u2019s got that vision.Are you confident though that this is going to get approved?We want this to go through, and I think that all the shareholders who are already present should really consider that this is a great way forward and sort of a path to a much higher sort of return.Want more fintech news in your inbox?

{"source": "TechCrunch_Historical", "title": "Bolt\u2019s Breslow faces uphill battle with proposed cramdown", "content": "Update:We spoke with Ashesh Shah, the founder and CEO of the fund leading Bolt\u2019s proposed $450 million raise for some much-needed additional detail on the deal.Read the full interview here.Bolt\u2019s aggressive ultimatum to its existing shareholders \u2014 in which it told them to buy many more shares at higher prices or it would take back their shares for payment of 1 cent a share \u2014 will be an expensive uphill battle, an expert familiar with Bolt\u2019s corporate charter tells TechCrunch.To recap: On Tuesday,\u00a0when newsbrokethat one-click checkout startupBoltwas attempting to raise $450 million at a potential $14 billion valuation, more than one head turned.This was a company that had seen a lot of controversy, including itsoutspokenfounder Ryan Breslow stepping down in February 2022. Part of the news of that giant new funding round included Breslow coming back as CEO. This comes after\u00a0allegations that hemisled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow also was embroiled ina legal battlewith investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out.So it came as a surprise to many that a letter to investors spelled out a term sheet that would not only bring a significant capital infusion but also Breslow back at the helm of the company.The proposed deal was presented to preferred shareholders in an email from Bolt\u2019s interim CEO Justin Grooms that reportedly said: \u201cWe are finalizing a $450+ million Series F funding round from UAE- and UK-based investment firms, which will elevate our total valuation to over $14 billion, a considerable leap from our $11 billion valuation during the Series E1 round in 2022. In addition to the investment from these investment firms, Bolt may receive additional amounts from existing Bolt investors who may participate in the Series F funding round.\u201dJournalist Eric Newcomerreportedon Tuesday that as of the end of March, Bolt\u2019s annualized run-rate was at $28 million in revenue and that the company had $7 million in gross profit. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that$11 billion valuationachieved in January of 2022.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Specifically, there was pushback on Breslow potentially receiving a $2 million bonus for returning as CEO, plus an additional $1 million of back pay.The question now is: If shareholders don\u2019t agree to the terms of the proposed transaction, can Bolt force a buyback or conversion of shares and really pay them only a penny per share?The short answer? Not likely, according to Andre Gharakhanian, partner at venture capital law firmSilicon Legal Strategy, who has viewed the company\u2019s charter. He described the proposed transaction as \u201ca twist on the pay-to-play structure.\u201d\u201cPay to play\u201d is a term used in term sheets that benefits new investors at the expense of old. It grows in popularity during market downturns (which is why it has become increasingly common in 2024, according todata from Cooley.) Essentially, it forces existing investors to buy all the pro rata shares they are entitled to or the company will take some punitive action, like converting their shares from preferred shares, with extra rights, to common shares,explains AngelList.In Bolt\u2019s case this is \u201cactually not a forced conversion like most pay-to-plays. Instead, it\u2019s a forced buyback. The goal is the same \u2014 to pressure existing investors to continue to support the company and diminish the ownership of those who are not providing that support,\u201d Gharakhanian said. \u201cHowever, instead of automatically converting non-participating investors into common \u2014 they are buying back 2/3 of the non-participating investors\u2019 preferred stock at $0.01/share.\u201dThe catch, he said, is that virtually all VC-backed companies include in their corporate charters that a proposed transaction like this requires some level of approval from preferred stockholders, typically approval from the majority. Those are the very people that Bolt is trying to strong arm.There are more nuances involved, but \u201cit\u2019s still a bumpy road to get this properly approved,\u201d he told TechCrunch.He added: \u201cWhat I think is happening here is that this was merely a term sheet put out by the company/lead investor that got signed (no formal board/stockholder approval is required to sign a term sheet) and they are now offering the deal to existing investors.\u00a0It\u2019s early stages and making headlines because of the salacious points and Bolt\u2019s crazy history.\u201dThat, however, doesn\u2019t mean he thinks the deal won\u2019t be approved. Because the true gun to investors\u2019 heads isn\u2019t being forced to buy more shares at prices they don\u2019t want to pay, it\u2019s what happens to the company if new financing can\u2019t materialize.\u201cEveryone going into this knows that you\u2019re going to need to get the requisite approval from the existing investors to actually close the deal. Non-participants are getting screwed and everyone knows it,\u201d he said.So what will typically happen next is \u201cweeks of hemming and hawing,\u201d as the deal is negotiated and final documents drawn.\u00a0\u201cBut if the company truly has no other alternatives, the non-participating investors will often relent and consent to the deal,\u201d he says.All of this back and forth also means that legal fees for pay-to-play deals can be high, as high as an acquisition deal. But unlike a happy exit acquisition, this type of deal generates a \u201cgeneral bad mood,\u201d he added.Interestingly, Gharakhanian pointed out that an amendment was added to Bolt\u2019s charter in May of 2022 saying that if the company wanted to enter into an employment agreement or anything compensatory with Breslow before October 7, 2024, it could not do so without getting a majority of preferred shareholders to agree.According to the charter, he said, carrying out the proposed transaction is \u201clikely still going to need the majority of existing preferred shareholders to consent to the deal.\u201dTechCrunch has reached out to Bolt, Grooms, Breslow, The London Fund, and Pamnani for comment.Want more fintech news in your inbox?

In this case, it\u2019s a straightforward one-handed \u201cnunchuk,\u201das they were once called, though this one-handed form factor is now more common in VR setups. As the company puts it:\u201cThrough years of research, testing and collaboration with players with disabilities, and accessibility experts, we designed the Xbox Adaptive Joystick as a wired companion to Xbox controllers, specifically for players with limited mobility.\u201cThe Xbox Adaptive Joystick\u2019s versatility allows players to seamlessly incorporate the controller into existing gaming setups \u2013 it can be controlled with one hand, mounted via tabletops, or used with non-hand body parts.\u201dThere are other one-handed joysticks out there, but having something that works well out of the box with other gaming accessibility tools is very helpful, andthe price is right at $30. You don\u2019t get wireless connectivity, sadly, but most accessible setups rely on wired devices anyway.One cool feature is the ability to use 3D-printed joystick \u201ctoppers\u201d \u2014 normally a rubber or silicone disc, but not everyone can use those. Why not something taller, or wider, or thinner, or with little holes in it so you can attach a string or wire?

And there\u2019s the 8BitDo Lite SE, specifically designed for the accessibility market, which puts all the Xbox controller buttons right on the front like an old-school arcade stick (there\u2019s one for Switch too).

The AI giant argued that SB 1047, introduced by Wiener in February, would stifle innovation and push talent out of California \u2014 a position Wiener quickly replied \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d\u201cThe AI revolution is only just beginning, and California\u2019s unique status as the global leader in AI is fueling the state\u2019s economic dynamism,\u201d said OpenAI\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon in the letter obtained by TechCrunch. \u201cSB 1047 would threaten that growth, slow the pace of innovation, and lead California\u2019s world-class engineers and entrepreneurs to leave the state in search of greater opportunity elsewhere. Given those risks, we must protect America\u2019s AI edge with a set of federal policies \u2014 rather than state ones \u2014 that can provide clarity and certainty for AI labs and developers while also preserving public safety.\u201dThe company joinsbroad local pushback against SB 1047on Tuesday, adding its take to those of trade groups representing Google and Meta, investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, prominent AI researchers and California Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Zoe Lofgren.An OpenAI spokesperson says the company has been in discussions with Senator Wiener\u2019s office about the bill for months. However, Senator Wiener says the AI lab\u2019s argument that SB 1047 would push AI companies out of California is \u201ctired.\u201dWiener pointed out in apress releaseon Wednesday that OpenAI doesn\u2019t actually \u201ccriticize a single provision of the bill.\u201d He says the company\u2019s claim that companies will leave California because of SB 1047 \u201cmakes no sense given that SB 1047 is not limited to companies headquartered in California.\u201d As we\u2019vepreviously reported,SB 1047 affects all AI model developers thatdo businessin Californiaand meet certain size thresholds.In other words, whether an AI company was based in San Jose or San Antonio, if they let Californians use their products, they would be subject to these restrictions. (An example of an effective law with this type of scope isIllinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act.)That said, Bloomberg reports that OpenAI hasput conversations about expanding its San Francisco officeson hold amid concerns about California\u2019s regulatory landscape. OpenAI has had an office in San Francisco\u2019s Mission district for years, and recently moved into a new office in the city\u2019s Mission Bay region, previously occupied by Uber.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

However, Congress has not done so, and we are skeptical Congress will do so.\u201d Tech companies have taken similar stances regarding privacy laws in the past, calling for federal regulation knowing it will be slow to come, and Californiaended up stepping up there as well.OpenAI has endorsedseveral federal bills regulating AI models, one of which authorizes the United States AI Safety Institute as a federal body that sets standards and guidelines for AI models. From a high level, that\u2019s fairly similar to what SB 1047\u2019s Board of Frontier Models is supposed to do.California lawmakerssignificantly amended SB 1047to give Governor Newsom a less controversial AI bill to sign, but they\u2019ve failed to convince Silicon Valley\u2019s most important AI lab the bill is worth passing.SB 1047 is now headed for a final vote in California\u2019s Assembly and could land on Governor Newsom\u2019s desk by the end of the month.

It\u2019s been accused in the past of being a dumping ground for get-rich-quick scams and listicles. But, as Stubblebine notes in his post, the company has undertaken a number of efforts to improve its overall content mix.In 2023, Medium launched Boost, an initiative to curate high-quality articles for readers. That same year, the platform beefed up its moderation efforts, removing over a million spam posts (Medium removed nearly 10 million last month, per Stubblebine), and rolled out a program to invite published authors to verify their identity by claiming their books.

There is no video tutorial.\u201cWe saw this and we were like, \u2018OK, what kind of video did it send?\u2019 and then we were like, \u2018Oh snap, this is a problem,\u2019\u201d Crivello told TechCrunch.Thevideo the AI sent the clientwas the music video to Rick Astley\u2019s 1987 dance-pop hit \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d In more familiar terms: the client got Rickrolled. By an AI.Rickrolling is a bait-and-switch meme that\u2019s over 15 years old. In one incident that popularized the meme, Rockstar Games released the much-hyped \u201cGrand Theft Auto IV\u201d trailer on its website, but traffic was so immense that the site crashed. Some people had managed to download and post the video onto other sites like YouTube, sharing the links so that people could see the trailer. But one 4chan user decided to play a prank and share the link to Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d Seventeen years later, people are still pranking their friends by sharing the Astley song at inopportune moments \u2014 now the music video has over1.5 billion viewson YouTube.This internet prank is so ubiquitous that inevitably, large language models like ChatGPT, which powers Lindy, picked up on it.\u201cThe way these models work is they try to predict the most likely next sequence of text,\u201d Crivello said. \u201cSo it starts like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to send you a video!\u2019 So what\u2019s most likely after that?

Lindy\u2019s accidental Rickroll is particularly remarkable because the AI organically reproduced this very specific user behavior, which informed its hallucination. But traces of internet humor seep into AI in other ways, which Google learned the hard way when itlicensed Reddit datato train its AI. As a hub of user-generated content \u2014 much of which is satirical \u2014 Google\u2019s AI ended up telling a user you can make cheese better stick to pizza dough by adding glue.\u201cIn the Google case, it wasn\u2019t exactly making stuff up,\u201d Crivello said. \u201cIt was based on content \u2014 it\u2019s just that the content was bad.\u201dAs LLMs rapidly improve, Crivello thinks that we won\u2019t see as many gaffes like this in the future. Plus, Crivello says it\u2019s easier than ever to patch these mishaps. In the early days of Lindy, if one of its AI assistants couldn\u2019t complete the task the user asked, the AI would say it\u2019s working on it but never deliver the product. (Oddly enough, that sounds pretty human.)\u201cIt was really hard for us to patch that issue,\u201d Crivello said. \u201cBut when GPT-4 came out, we just added a prompt that was like, \u2018If the user asks you to do something you\u2019re not able to do, just tell them you can\u2019t do it.\u2019 And that fixed it.\u201dFor now, the good news is that the customer who got Rickrolled might not even know it.\u201cI don\u2019t even know that the customer saw it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe followed up immediately like, \u2018Oh hey, this is the right link to the video,\u2019 and the customer didn\u2019t say anything about the first link.\u201d", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/this-founder-had-to-train-his-ai-to-not-rickroll-people/", "timestamp": "2024-08-21T00:00:00", "scraped_at": "2025-08-27T12:46:39.105700", "sentiment_score": -0.24969999492168427, "symbol": "GOOGL"}

Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon posted record profit in the first half of the year underscoring how local challengers toNvidiaare gaining traction as Beijing looks to boost its domestic industry.Cambricon is among a plethora of companies in Chinathat are vying to be an alternative to American giant Nvidia when it comes to providing the chips required to train and run artificial intelligence applications and models.In the first half of the year, Cambricon said revenue surged more than 4,000% year-on-year to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million) and net profit hit a record 1.04 billion yuan. The numbers remain small when compared to Nvidia whichreported $44 billion of revenuein its February to April quarter. The tech giant is due to report itsfiscal second-quarter earningslater today.Still, Cambricon's surge in revenue highlights how tech companies in China are searching for potential alternatives to Nvidia, given the continuous threat that they could be cut off from American technology.Nvidia wasblocked earlier this yearfrom selling its pared back H20 chip to China. It has since been allowed to resume exports to China but must share15% of its revenuefrom sales to the country with the U.S government.Meanwhile, China hasreportedly been discouraginglocal firms to buy Nvidia's H20 chips. Chinese tech giantshave been using local chipsas well as the Nvidia hardware they have been able to get their hands on, which is helping companies like Cambricon.Shares of Cambricon have more than doubled this year and it has added north of $40 billion to its market capitalization, according to S&P Capital IQ. The total value of the company is around $80 billion.Nvidia's strength has not only been in its hardware but also in its software which developers have become accustomed to using. Cambricon said Wednesday that it too is improving its software offering and is working on next-generation hardware.Nevertheless, China's Nvidia rivals face many obstacles when it comes to beating the competition. Their technology remains far behind that of Nvidia's while the longer term outlook looks even more challenging because of export controls cuttingChina off from the most advanced chipmaking techniques, blocking advancements in China's domestic AI chip efforts.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/china-nvidia-rival-cambricon-posts-record-profit-4000percent-revenue-jump.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-27T13:14:11.798509", "sentiment_score": 0.5929999947547913, "symbol": "NVDA"}

Parents with kids under 18 saw a five-point drop.The lone exception was child-free Americans, with 42% optimistic in 2025 about becoming wealthy, up from 41% in 2023. That bucks the overall trend, as just 38% of Americans who don't currently see themselves as wealthy believe they ever will be, down from41% in 2023. For parents, finding room in the budget forchild-related expenseshas gotten harder. It costs around $30,000 annually to raise a child young enough to require full-time day care \u2014 up 36% since 2023,according to a separate LendingTree study. That figure includes the cost of day care, extra rent, food, clothing, transportation and health insurance, although prices can vary widely by location.Not every family faces all of these costs, of course. Some rely on relatives instead of formal child care, while others already live in larger homes or have fixed housing or transportation costs that don't change much when they have children.Even so, the increase has been dramatic. Nationally, day-care costs alone jumped by an average of 52% since 2023, largely due to inflation, higher wages for child-care workers and a shortage of providers, LendingTree says. Families now spend about 23% of their income on child-related expenses, according to the study.\"Most Americans are on a budget and don't have a ton of wiggle room,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst, wrote in a blog post on the study. \"When a big cost like child care shoots up by 40%-plus, it can be a real crisis.\"Child-free Americans, by contrast, may be feeling less financial pressure, giving them more freedom to save and invest.

Yesterday, Hut 8 unveiled plans todevelop 1.53 gigawatts(GW)of new capacity across four U.S. sites, in Louisiana, Texas and Illinois, more than doubling its power under management to 2.55 GW. Palmer raised Hut 8's price target to $36 from $33 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock. The new price target suggests nearly 40% upside from yesterday's close just below $26. Palmer noted the update was significant because it showed a clear path to monetizing Hut 8\u2019s energy pipeline, with the company already securing land and power agreements, building infrastructure and negotiating with potential customers. By separating its mining operations into ABTC, Hut 8 aims to position itself as an energy infrastructure pure-play, giving it better access to cheaper project financing by avoiding the volatility tied to bitcoin revenues, the analyst said. The company has up to $2.4 billion in liquidity to support the expansion, including $1.2 billion in bitcoin, $330 million in credit facilities and a $1 billion equity program, the report noted. Hut 8 is a flexible bet on both bitcoin and the artificial intelligence(AI)/high performance computing(HPC)boom, Palmer said.

With the end of August in touching distance, the largest cryptocurrency seems set to close the month in the red, as it has done for the past three years. Still, that's the best August return since 2021, and there are signs in the options market that gains may be coming before the month-end expiry. Bitcoin and ether optionsworth over $14.6 billionare set to expire Friday with the \u201cmax pain\u201d level at $116,000. Max pain is the strike price at which the largest number of options expire worthless, generally causing the greatest financial pain to option holders and greatest benefit to options sellers. That's above the current price, so sellers have an incentive to push BTC higher toward that level to minimize their costs. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader market, has added 3.2% in the past 24 hours and the CoinDesk 80, which encompasses a large swathe of smaller tokens, rose 4%. For the longer term, bitcoin's 200-day moving average has just crossed above $100,000. BTC has been trading above the 200-day level since the end of April, underscoring the strength of its long-term uptrend. The 200-day moving average is a long-term trend indicator that smooths price action over roughly six months, helping investors distinguish between bullish and bearish market conditions.

This underscores elevated sell-side pressure and, when combined with other signals, suggests the market has entered the late phase of the cycle\". Since the start of 2024, LTHs(defined as investors who have held bitcoin for at least 155 days)have realized 3.27 million BTC in profits. This figure has now surpassed the 2021 bull run(just over 3 million BTC)and is far ahead of the 2013 cycle. However, it still trails the 2017 bull run, when realized profits reached 3.93 million BTC. For context, bitcoin\u2019s average price was around $1,000 in 2015, compared with today\u2019s levels which are roughly 100 times higher. This highlights that the market has absorbed a significantly larger dollar value of realized profits. The sell-side supply has been enormous, with ongoing rotation of capital, including from long-dormant \"OG\" coins. Recent market activity illustrates this dynamic: approximately 80,000 BTC was listed for sale atGalaxy, while another 26,000 BTC recently became active. Altogether, about 100,000 BTC has come up for sale and the market has seen a slight correction, which shows how liquid the market has become. Exchange-traded funds(ETFs)have played a role in facilitating this rotation, while trading volumes have also expanded broadly across the market.

Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, said on Wednesday that there were \u201cforeign actors\u201d attempting to influence the future ofGreenlandand that all such efforts were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He has summoned Mark Stroh, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the US embassy in Copenhagen and its most senior diplomat inDenmarkat present, for a meeting at the foreign ministry. Denmark has been shaken by Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that the US wants totake control of the vast Arctic island\u2014 a semi-autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark \u2014 from Copenhagen, and his refusal to rule out using force to do so. The Scandinavian country had already summoned the top US diplomat in May, following a report in the Wall Street Journal that a classified message wassent to American intelligence agenciesurging them to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who support Trump\u2019s ambition to take over the island. The latest report by DR, the Danish public broadcaster, said Danish authorities were aware of at least three US citizens with alleged links to the Trump administration gathering information in Greenland and conducting influence operations. Rasmussen said in television interviews that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the report. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we gain some insight into this so that our people \u2014 in both Greenland and Denmark \u2014 know what it is that we risk being up against.\u201d Denmark\u2019s security and intelligence service (PET) said on Wednesday that its assessment was that \u201cGreenland, especially in the current situation, is the target of influence campaigns of various kinds. PET expects that such campaigns have the purpose of creating a split in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.\u201d Some senior Danish officials sought to downplay the significance of summoning Stroh, saying that the three US citizens appeared to act in an amateur way and there was no link established to US intelligence. Recommended But Danish politicians reacted with dismay. \u201cThis means the whole misery over Greenland is not over,\u201d former foreign minister Martin Lidegaard told the TV channel TV2. He added: \u201cThis is putting a heavy strain on our relationship with the US \u2014 and Americans should know that too.\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark\u2019s parliament, said: \u201cIt is beyond a joke that they try to infiltrate Greenland\u2019s society in this way. It is Greenland itself who must decide what we want and what future we want.\u201d The allegations come just days after the Trump administration caused pain to Danish business by issuing a stop-work order on an almost complete offshore wind farm co-owned by \u00d8rsted. That came on the same day that Rasmussen and Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the US signed a partnership with California\u2019s Governor Gavin Newsom, the self-styled leader of the resistance to Trump. Danish officials deny there is a connection between the two events. The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0The US is currently without an ambassador in Copenhagen despite Trump naming Ken Howery, who is close to Elon Musk, in December. In a separate move, Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Wednesday apologised to the thousands of Greenlandic women who over decades were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils. She acknowledged that the case had caused \u201canger and sorrow\u201d in Greenland as well as hurting perceptions of Denmark. \u201cWe cannot change what has happened. But we can take responsibility. Therefore, on behalf of Denmark, I would like to say: sorry.\u201d Many Greenlanders use this issue to express why they want to gain independence from Denmark, but surveys suggest the 57,000 on the Arctic island are reluctant to do so imminently for fear of losing out economically.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c067d901-7acf-4b5b-8aa7-5673a2891b71", "timestamp": "2025-08-27T13:14:51.881418", "sentiment_score": -0.8738999962806702, "symbol": "TGT"}

The agent, Claude for Chrome, is rolling out to a group of 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic\u2019s Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month. The company is also opening awaitlistfor other interested users. By adding an extension to Chrome, select users can now chat with Claude in a sidecar window that maintains context of everything happening in their browser. Users can also give the Claude agent permission to take actions in their browser and complete some tasks on their behalf. The browser is quickly becoming the next battleground for AI labs, which aim to use browser integrations to offer more seamless connections between AI systems and their users. Perplexity recently launched its own browser,Comet, which features an AI agent that can offload tasks for users. OpenAI is reportedly close to launching its ownAI-powered browser, which is rumored to have similar features to Comet. Meanwhile, Google has launched Gemini integrations withChromein recent months. The race to develop AI-powered browsers is especially pressing given Google\u2019s looming antitrust case, in which a final decision is expected any day now. The federal judge in the case has suggested he may force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Perplexity submitted anunsolicited $34.5 billion offer for Chrome, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested his company would bewilling to buy itas well. In the Tuesday blog post, Anthropic warned that the rise of AI agents with browser access poses new safety risks. Last week, Brave\u2019s security team said it found that Comet\u2019s browser agent could be vulnerable toindirect prompt-injection attacks, where hidden code on a website could trick the agent into executing malicious instructions when it processed the page. (Perplexity\u2019s head of communications, Jesse Dwyer, told TechCrunch in an email that the vulnerability Brave raised has been fixed.) Anthropic says it hopes to use this research preview as a chance to catch and address novel safety risks; however, the company has already introduced several defenses against prompt injection attacks. The company says its interventions reduced the success rate of prompt injection attacks from 23.6% to 11.2%. For example, Anthropic says users can limit Claude\u2019s browser agent from accessing certain sites in the app\u2019s settings, and the company has, by default, blocked Claude from accessing websites that offer financial services, adult content, and pirated content. The company also says that Claude\u2019s browser agent will ask for user permission before \u201ctaking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.\u201d This isn\u2019t Anthropic\u2019s first foray into AI models that can control your computer screen. In October 2024, the company launched an AI agent that couldcontrol your PC\u2014 however, testing at the time revealed that the model was quite slow and unreliable. The capabilities of agentic AI models have improved quite a bit since then. TechCrunch has found that modern browser-using AI agents, such as Comet andChatGPT Agent, are fairly reliable at offloading simple tasks for users. However, many of these agentic systems still struggle with more complex problems. Topics Senior AI Reporter Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Even Intel is unconvinced. Intel Foundry, which manufactures custom semiconductors for outside customers, has not been fruitful for the company. The business division lost out on potential big contracts, like one with Sony,according to Reuters, and has cost the company significantly more than it has brought in. Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of$3.1 billionin the second quarter. The company has also laid off thousands of people since the beginning of the year, with thefoundry business unit being hit especially hard. Differences over how Intel would turn around itsstruggling foundry businesswas partially responsible for Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s resignation from the company board in August 2024. Tan wasappointed CEOin spring 2025. Kevin Cassidy, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, told TechCrunch he doesn\u2019t see how this deal will solve Intel\u2019s problems. Intel Foundry doesn\u2019t need money to solve its issues, he said, instead it needs to change its approach to its customers. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand customer service,\u201d Cassidy said of Intel Foundry\u2019s struggles to sign customers. \u201cThey have always manufactured internally, the manufacturing group was king. It\u2019s hard to be a customer service-focused group when you think you know better.\u201d Intel did not respond to a request for comment. Intel recently acknowledged the potential downsides of this deal inan SEC filingposted Monday. The company highlighted the risks it carries for its investors and customers \u2014\u00a0two groups of people Intel naturally relies on. This deal dilutes existing shareholders and reduces their governance rights. The Trump administration said it would vote alongside Intel\u2019s interests, which could help the company move its ideas forward; but business decisions that actively sour an existing investor base conflicts with efforts to drum up investor interest. \u201cI would be disappointed if I was a stockholder,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIntel gave up another 430 million shares, and diluted my shares, and [they] were able to buy it at a 20% discount.\u201d Intel also mentioned the potential impact this could have on its international business. The vast majority of the company\u2019s revenue in its last fiscal year, 76%, came from outside the U.S., the company reported. Amid the current U.S.-led international trade turmoil, companies outside the United States will now have to grapple with whether or not to work with a company partially owned by the U.S. government. Not everyone is doom and gloom about the recent transaction. Cody Acree, managing director and senior research analyst at Benchmark Company, told TechCrunch he doesn\u2019t see the company\u2019s international customers shying away from Intel. Acree said the deal isn\u2019t perfect, but the government\u2019s commitment to Intel\u2019s future may give the chipmaker the boost it needs \u2014\u00a0even if it\u2019s just a small step on a long road to recovery. \u201cIntel has shown that it\u2019s been struggling for the last decade and may need some kind of government intervention; a bail out is probably too harsh of a term, but the government intervention is being seen as at least a stepping stone toward reinvigorating Intel,\u201d Acree said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with it being a fix-all by any means. It\u2019s at least encouraging to know that the government is backing Intel instead of challenging the leadership as they were a month ago.\u201d Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, agreed that a deal with the U.S. government could be positive. In an interview before the deal was formally announced, Rocco said that this could give Intel a bigger role in the administration\u2019s current push for domestic AI prowess through initiatives like OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle\u2019sStargate initiativeand bringing semiconductor manufacturing stateside. \u201cThe market is going to be so big, the data center and chip market, even if they get a small slice,\u201d Rocco said. \u201cThere is room for them to succeed. This will be a positive. You have to have a five-to-10-year time horizon.\u201d Still, both analysts cautioned the deal won\u2019t be Intel\u2019s savior. For a true, long-standing rescue, Intel needs to look inward. While the Trump administration claims it will be a passive investor, that doesn\u2019t mean its involvement can\u2019t drum up business for the company, Acree said. While that hopefully wouldn\u2019t come from pressure or force, Cassidy said, it definitely could. Even though the government might not have to. Unlike higher education, corporate America has proven itself more than happy to lean toward the Trump administration\u2019s goals and policies. Companies havegutted their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs\u2014despite hurting themselves in the process. A prevalence of pro-America sentiment has become saturated inadvertisementsandcompany communicationsince Donald Trump took office in January. If the Trump administration tells American companies to buy Intel\u2019s chips and hardware, they might not have to do as much convincing to get companies on board. Acree and Cassidy said the real test for Intel won\u2019t be the deal, or even the optics of it. It will be whether Intel can drum up interest for its 14A chipmaking processor. Tan has said the companywould not start production on its 14A chipmaking processuntil they secured substantial customer interest. \u201cThere is still no guarantee that Intel is going to be able to come back into the market at the leading edge,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIntel has been burning cash for quite a few years, I don\u2019t know if it is just more money to buy time to find the formula to get them back on the leading edge.\u201d Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The \u201cNo Azure for Apartheid\u201d group livestreamed their sit-in on Twitch, hoisting banners, chanting \u2018Brad Smith, you can\u2019t hide, you\u2019re supporting genocide!\u2019 and posting a mock legal summons charging Smith with \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d Microsoft did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment earlier in the day, but a few hours after the occupation, Smith held a hastily called press conference beside his desk to address the extraordinary events. Of the seven people involved, he said, just two were current Microsoft employees and one was a former Google employee, Smith said. He also told reporters gathered on the scene \u2014including from GeekWire\u2014 that after the protesters refused to leave when asked, Redmond police had to physically remove them from the building. Police arrested all seven on charges including trespassing and obstruction. Smith said the protesters\u2019 actions were \u201cnot necessary in order to get us to pay attention\u201d and that such activity \u201cdistracts from the real dialogue\u201d that Microsoft is having with employee groups of different backgrounds, faiths, and cultures inside Microsoft. According to a report earlier in the day byThe Verge, the protest included both active Microsoft workers and former employees who\u2019d been fired for previous activism. Monday\u2019s escalation follows months of protests over Microsoft\u2019s cloud contracts with Israel, including recent arrests at company headquarters. A recentGuardian investigationrevealed Israel uses Microsoft\u2019s services to store data from millions of calls each day made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Monday\u2019s corporate takeover mirrored tactics from Google employees more than a year ago. In April 2024, nine Google workers staged coordinated protests across New York and California offices, with five occupying Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian\u2019s office for nine hours. They wrote demands on his whiteboard and wore \u201cGoogler against genocide\u201d shirts. The Google protesters targeted Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract with Amazon that provides Israel\u2019s government and military with cloud computing and AI tools. The employees\u2019 sit-ins and arrests were similarly livestreamed on Twitch; three days later, 28 employees involved in those protests werefired. Update: This story was updated to reflect Smith\u2019s comments, which were made hours after the protesters in his office were removedbut after this piece was first published.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "DOGE uploaded live copy of Social Security database to \u2018vulnerable\u2019 cloud server, says whistleblower", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A top Social Security Administration official turned whistleblower says members of the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to a vulnerable cloud server, putting the personal information of most Americans at risk of compromise. Charles Borges, the Social Security Administration\u2019s chief data officer, said ina newly released whistleblower complaint published Tuesdaythat other top agency officials signed off on a decision in June to upload \u201ca live copy of the country\u2019s Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight,\u201d despite Borges raising concerns. The database, known as the Numerical Identification System, contains more than 450 million records containing all of the data submitted as part of a Social Security application, including the applicant\u2019s name, place of birth, citizenship, and the Social Security numbers of their family members, as well as other sensitive personal and financial information. Borges said members of DOGE, theteam of former Elon Musk employees appointed to government under the guise of reducing fraud and waste, copied the sensitive database to an agency-run Amazon-hosted cloud server \u201capparently lacking in independent security controls,\u201d such as who was accessing the data and how they were using it. The lack of security protections violated internal agency security controls and federal privacy laws, the complaint alleges. Borges said by allowing DOGE to be administrators of the agency\u2019s cloud, the DOGE operatives would be able to create \u201cpublicly accessible services,\u201d meaning that they could allow public access to the cloud system and any of the sensitive data stored inside. Borges warned in the complaint that if this information were compromised, \u201cit is possible that the sensitive [personally identifiable information] on every American including health diagnoses, income levels and banking information, family relationships, and personal biographic data could be exposed publicly, and shared widely.\u201d The complaint said any compromise or unauthorized access to the database would have \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d on the U.S. Social Security program, describing a worst-case scenario as potentially having to reissue everyone\u2019s Social Security numbers. While a federal restraining order in Marchinitially blocked DOGE staffersfrom accessing the country\u2019s database of Social Security records, the Supreme Court lifted the order on June 6, paving the way for DOGE\u2019s access. In the days that followed, DOGE allegedly worked to seek internal approvals from the agency\u2019s top brass, per Borges\u2019 complaint. The agency\u2019s chief information officerAram Moghaddassiapproved the move to copy the database to the agency\u2019s cloud, saying he \u201cdetermined the business need is higher than the security risk\u201d and that he accepts \u201call risks\u201d with the project. The complaint also saysMichael Russo, a senior DOGE operative who previously served as the agency\u2019s chief information officer prior to Moghaddassi but remains at the agency, also approved moving live Social Security data to the cloud. Borges said he first raised issues internally at the agency but later blew the whistle to urge members of Congress to \u201cengage in immediate oversight to address these serious concerns,\u201d according toa statementby his attorney, Andrea Meza, at the Government Accountability Project. This is the latest accusation of poor cybersecurity practices by the administration and its representatives,including DOGE, since President Trump took office earlier in January. Since January, members of DOGE have takensweeping control of most U.S. federal departmentsand their datasets of citizens\u2019 data. When reached by TechCrunch, Elizabeth Huston, a spokesperson for the White House, would not say if the administration was aware of the complaint and deferred comment to the Social Security Administration. In an emailed response, Social Security Administration spokesperson Nick Perrine said the agency \u201cstores personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information.\u201d \u201cThe data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA\u2019s Information Security team,\u201d the spokesperson added. The spokesperson said the agency was \u201cnot aware of any compromise to this environment.\u201d Data breaches involving federal government data stored in the cloud are rare but not unheard of. In 2023, TechCrunch reported that theU.S. Department of Defense publicly exposed thousands of sensitive military emailsonline due to a security lapse. While the email data was stored in Microsoft Azure\u2019s separate cloud dedicated for government customers, a misconfigurationallowed the contents of a military unit\u2019s emailsto publicly spill online. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated where the DOD\u2019s exposed email was hosted. The story now accurately reflects that the exposed data was hosted on Microsoft\u2019s Azure.
