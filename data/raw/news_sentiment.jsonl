However, by June, same-store sales began increasing again.\"Exiting the quarter, we returned to positive comp and transaction trends, which have continued into July,\" Boatwright told analysts on the company's conference call.He later reiterated the company's belief that it can return to same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits in the long term and achieve average unit volumes for its restaurants of $4 million.Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte have filed a US defamation lawsuit against Candace Owens, a rightwing influencer and podcaster who has said France\u2019s first lady \u201cis in fact a man\u201d. The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware on Wednesday, accuses Owens of publishing \u201coutlandish, defamatory and far-fetched fictions\u201d, chief among them thatBrigitte Macronwas born male under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux. Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing. The suit is a rare case of a serving world leader personally suing an online influencer over their content, though it comes days after Donald TrumpsuedThe Wall Street Journal and its parent companies over a report of a letter that the US president allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document.

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:51.522664", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:53.125133", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267}

Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:54.643603", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes revenue from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year,  a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivery 337,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware on Wednesday, accuses Owens of publishing \u201coutlandish, defamatory and far-fetched fictions\u201d, chief among them thatBrigitte Macronwas born male under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux. Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing. The suit is a rare case of a serving world leader personally suing an online influencer over their content, though it comes days after Donald TrumpsuedThe Wall Street Journal and its parent companies over a report of a letter that the US president allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document. It says: \u201cPresident Macron has not participated in, nor is he the product of, any government mind control programmes.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d9bf7d2b-b834-4c19-8c66-8629e3046f24", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:27.261187", "sentiment_score": -0.7160000205039978}

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:30.658590", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:32.212689", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267}

Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:33.764620", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. While Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariff\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future. \u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter. The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year,  a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivery 337,000 vehicles. Tesla said Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document. It says: \u201cPresident Macron has not participated in, nor is he the product of, any government mind control programmes.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d9bf7d2b-b834-4c19-8c66-8629e3046f24", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:04.200495", "sentiment_score": -0.7160000205039978}

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:07.325068", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:08.867094", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Tom Hayes\u2019 conviction for Libor-rigging quashed by UK\u2019s highest court", "content": " Alistair Grayin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:10.400759", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. While Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future. \u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter. The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year, a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivered 337,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

Intelreported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue, as the company's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant cuts in chip factory construction. The stock ticked higher in extended trading.Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: Loss of 10 cents per share, adjusted.Revenue: $12.86 billion versus $11.92 billion estimatedIntel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, inthe year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not comparable to analyst estimates due to an $800 million impairment charge, \"related to excess tools with no identified re-use,\" the company said. That resulted in an EPS adjustment of about 20 cents.The report was Intel's second since Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March, promising to make the chipmaker's products competitive again, and to reduce bureaucracy and layers of management, including slashing staff in Oregon and California.In a memo to employees published on Thursday, Tan said that the first few months of his tenure had \"not been easy.\" He said that the company had \"completed the majority\" of its planned layoffs, amounting to 15% of the workforce, and that it plans to end the year with 75,000 employees. Intel previously said it was trying to reduce operating expenses by $17 billion in 2025.Intel shares are up about 13% this year as of Thursday's close after plummeting 60% in 2024, their worst year on record.Tan also announced several other spending cuts in the memo, particularly in the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and is still looking for a big customer to anchor the business.Intel said its foundry business had an operating loss of $3.17 billion on $4.4 billion in revenue.Tan said that Intel had cancelled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and will consolidate its testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. He added that the company would slow down the pace of its construction of a cutting-edge chip factory in Ohio, depending on market demand and if it can secure big customers for the facility.\"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon \u2013 without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote. \"In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.\"Tan wrote that the company's forthcoming chip manufacturing process, called 14A, will be built out based on confirmed customer commitments.\"There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,\" Tan wrote.The company's client computing group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, had $7.9 billion in sales, down 3% on an annual basis.Revenue in the data center group, which includes some AI chips but is mostly central processors for servers, rose 4% to $3.9 billion. Tan wrote in his memo that Intel wants to regain market share in data center chips, and is looking for a permanent leader for the business. Longtime rivalAdvanced Micro Deviceshas increasingly beenwinning server businessfrom cloud customers.Tan added he would personally review and approve all chip designs before they are taped out, which is the final step of the design process before a new chip is manufactured.WATCH:How U.S. companies are mitigating Trump tariffs with foreign trade zones", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/intel-intc-earnings-report-q2-2025.html", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:09:35.625466", "sentiment_score": -0.8683000206947327}

On Wednesday evening Tesla reported that second-quarter profitdeclinedmore than a fifth on slowing car sales. Musk said that Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-EV and solar power policies would further hit the company\u2019s earnings. \u201cWe\u2019re in this weird transition period where we\u2019ll lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said on Wednesday. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Trump\u2019s tax and spend actputs at riskthe billions of dollars in annual profit that Tesla makes from selling regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions.

His close relationship with Trump was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla but ended up alienating many left-leaning customers. After a tumultuous four months marked by clashes with Trump\u2019s cabinet, the world\u2019s richest man emerged as a leading critic of the administration\u2019s economic and trade policies, vowed to launch his own party and helped reignite speculation about the president\u2019s relationship with the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump in turn has suggested that the US government should turn Doge on Musk\u2019s empire, cancelling lucrative contracts for his companies that include SpaceX, its satellite broadband network Starlink and xAI. Tesla\u2019s adjusted net income fell to about $1.4bn for the second quarter, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn the previous year. Revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.7bn and its operating margin narrowed. \u201cThere was no attempt to sugar coat the market headwinds for EVs,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, adding that Tesla had to \u201ccross the chasm\u201d to the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, \u201cwhile absorbing slower volume, EV incentive elimination, tariffs and investing in new initiatives that may not make margins for years\u201d. Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Musk also renewed his threat to leave Tesla if he is not given more shares, after a Delaware judge struck down a pay package that would have been the largest in US history. If reinstated on appeal by Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court, the package would increase Musk\u2019s ownership of Tesla from just under 13 per cent to more than 20 per cent. \u201cThat is a major concern for me\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

Tesla has warned of a further hit to revenue from Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-electric vehicle policies in the US president\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d, darkening the outlook as second-quarter profits fell by more than a fifth. Trump\u2019s signature fiscal legislation puts at risk a crucial source of profit for Tesla that had allowed the electric-vehicle maker to sell billions of dollars of regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The hit to Tesla from the president\u2019s policies \u2014 including the loss of EV and solar power incentives \u2014 has deepened chief executiveElon Musk\u2019s rift with Trump, pulling the world\u2019s richest man back into politics despite his promise to investors to refocus his attention on the electric-car maker. \u201cWe are in the transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Teslashares fell 8 per cent in early trading on Thursday following Musk\u2019s comments. They have fallen more 30 per cent from a peak in mid-December. The billionaire\u2019s close relationship with Trump, after supporting his re-election bid, was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla. However, Musk\u2019s role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alienated some customers as he celebrated brutal cuts to the federal workforce. He left the White House in May after falling out with the president, becoming a fierce critic of the Republican\u2019s spending bill and pledging tolaunch his own political party. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. A consumer backlash against Musk\u2019s political activities has contributed to a sales slump at Tesla, which is also suffering from an ageing model line-up and greater EV competition from Chinese and western rivals. The Austin, Texas-based company on Wednesday reported that its adjusted net income came in close to analysts\u2019 expectations at $1.4bn for the three months through June, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn a year earlier. The carmaker warned Trump\u2019s policies would add to its difficulties in the coming months. Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla had a limited supply of vehicles and might not be able to deliver enough cars in time to meet orders if consumers rushed to beat the September deadline for the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases and leases. Teslastands to losemuch of the income from the sale of its regulatory credits after Trump\u2019s bill eliminated fines for non-compliance, throwing the future of emissions trading programmes in doubt. Revenue from the credits almost halved to $439mn in the quarter from a year before. Last year, the company made $2.8bn from these sales. The bill also threatens Tesla\u2019s other business lines by removing a range of incentives for renewable energy. Taneja said Tesla faced $300mn in additional tariff-related costs in the second quarter and warned this figure would increase through the year. The US has imposed higher tariffs on foreign-sourced cars and components, including battery cells that Tesla imports from China. \u201cWhile we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front,\u201d he added. In an attempt to revive its sales momentum, the company said it would aim to begin mass production of its delayed affordable model during the second half of the year. Recommended Tesla\u2019s revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.5bn in the second quarter from a year earlier, close to the average $22.7bn analyst estimate, according to data from Visible Alpha. Its operating margin dropped to 4.1 per cent, from 6.3 per cent. Reported net income declined 16 per cent to $1.2bn. With the slide in its automotive revenue, Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service, which launched in Austin last month. Musk said the number of robotaxis in operation would increase at \u201ca hyper-exponential rate\u201d, making the ride-hailing service available to half of the US population by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Despite the release of an upgraded version of its flagship Model Y sport utility vehicle, Tesla\u2019s sales have continued to sag in big European markets. Recommended Musk said he expected sales to improve in Europe if and when Tesla gets regulatory approval for its \u201cfull self-driving\u201d technology, which he said could happen this year. Earlier this month, Tesladisclosedit had sold 384,122 vehicles in the quarter, below the 389,000 forecast by analysts and down 13 per cent from 443,956 in the same period last year. Barclays analyst Dan Levy said the result was \u201cpositive, with improved fundamentals and narrative intact\u201d. But he added \u201cthe volume outlook remains uncertain\u201d and Tesla did not give a forecast for the number of cars it would build, as investors had expected.

District judge Robin Rosenberg on Wednesday argued that district courts did not have the power to release the records except in rare circumstances, and said the government\u2019s request was \u201cnot based on any of the exceptions\u201d to a federal rule governing the secrecy of grand jury files. The decision by the Florida judge came after Trump last week directed US attorney-general Pam Bondito unseal grand jury transcriptslinked to the financier, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The administration has faced weeks of mounting pressure over the Epstein case, which hasexposed fissuresin the president\u2019s Maga movement after he reneged on a campaign promise to make public files relating to the disgraced financier. A memo published by the justice department and FBI this month said there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that Epstein \u201cblackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions\u201d and that a \u201cclient list\u201d did not exist. That sparked outrage from some of the loudest voices in the Maga movement, many of whom called for Bondi to resign.Trumphas stood by his attorney-general. But the president faced fresh questions about his links to Epstein on Wednesday, when US media reported that Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche informed Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. Earlier this month, the president was asked by a reporter at the White House whether Bondi had told him that his name appeared in the files. He replied: \u201cNo, she has given us just a very quick briefing, and in terms of the credibility of the different things that they have seen.\u201d Trump has previously said he was Epstein\u2019s friend for 15 years, but claimed the two had a falling out more than 20 years ago. Recommended The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling in Florida. A Manhattan federal court is considering separate motions to unseal grand jury transcripts and a judge has asked the government for \u201cadditional submissions\u201d before ruling on whether to grant the request. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Bondi and Blanche stood by the memo from earlier this month, adding: \u201cNothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009as part of our routine briefing, we made the president aware of the findings.\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung said Trump kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club \u201cfor being a creep\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ef1ca342-28fa-4d02-9046-8495bded31ce", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:10:02.205487", "sentiment_score": -0.8029999732971191}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Zelenskyy signals retreat from power grab after mass protests in Ukraine", "content": " Christopher Millerin Kyiv PublishedJuly 24 2025 UpdatedJuly 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to soften his stance on bringing the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies under executive control on Thursday, approving a new bill that he said would guarantee the agencies\u2019 independence after taking advice from the UK prime minister.Zelenskyy said the bill would be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament. He said earlier he had discussed the legislation with British premier Sir Keir Starmer, who \u201csuggested involving experts who could contribute to long-term co-operation on anti-corruption initiatives\u2019\u2019.Zelenskyy\u2019s statement and his call with Starmer came after the Ukrainian leader\u2019s push to subordinate the agencies to his handpicked prosecutor-general sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The move was condemned by the EU and G7 members, while critics accused Zelenskyy of an authoritarian power grab.It remains unclear how far the new bill will go towards restoring full independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Sapo).Ukrainians\u2019 frustration with the president has boiled over amid a deepening political crisis of his own making. Protests in Kyiv on Wednesday involved roughly 10,000 demonstrators \u2014 more than triple the previous day \u2014 who shouted \u201cshame\u201d and demanded that Zelenskyy \u201cveto the law\u201d. Thousands more turned out in other cities including Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa. \u201cEveryone has heard what people are saying,\u2019\u2019 Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday night address to the nation, seeking to assuage public concern. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not falling on deaf ears.\u201dYaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition MP who was among those who voted against the law, said on Thursday that he and 47 other lawmakers had submitted a draft law to revoke the amendments embedded in the earlier one that limited the powers of Nabu and Sapo. The president said his push to put the prosecutor-general, whom he appointed, in charge of Nabu and Sapo was aimed at rooting out Russian spies.The protests against the decision have been some of the biggest since the 2014 Euromaidan uprising that set Ukraine on a western course. Soldiers said they had been ordered by military leaders to avoid attending the protests and to refrain from posting criticism on social media. But many still came out in uniform to protest in Kyiv. One veteran and double-amputee at a rally near the president\u2019s office held a sign that read: \u201cWe are fighting for Ukraine, not your impunity.\u201d The criticism of Zelenskyy has been scathing, marking an unprecedented shift in Ukraine\u2019s wartime discourse. Since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, many Ukrainians had largely refrained from public dissent to prioritise national unity, but that consensus is now showing signs of strain.Critics said the original law, rushed through parliament with unusual speed and secrecy, resembled infamous \u201cdictatorship laws\u201d from 2014 that gave pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych extraordinary powers. Nabu and Sapo welcomed Zelenskyy\u2019s revised version of the bill and said it restored \u201call procedural powers and guarantees of the independence of Nabu and Sapo\u201d. They said in a statement: \u201cNabu and Sapo participated in the preparation of the text and urge the Verkhovna Rada to adopt the president\u2019s initiative as a basis and in full as soon as possible. This will help prevent threats to criminal proceedings investigated by Nabu and Sapo.\u201dIn Washington, before Zelenskyy\u2019s latest concessions, Democrat senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican senator Lindsey Graham published a statement on Wednesday praising the \u201cenormous strides\u201d Ukraine had made on anti-corruption since 2014 despite Russia\u2019s aggression. But they added, \u201cwe fear [the new law] undermines much of that progress\u2019\u2019. The situation has unfolded as Russian forces gain territory in Ukraine at their fastest pace in more than a year and the air war escalates. Russian drone strikes overnight in the historic centre of Odesa injured at least four people, according to regional governor Oleh Kiper. The attack came hours after a third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul ended without significant progress towards ending the war. The Kremlin on Thursday said it did not see how Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy could meet before the end of August. Zelenskyy has said the issues\u00a0central to ending the largest armed conflict on European soil in generations could only be settled in a face-to-face meeting between himself and Putin.

On Thursday, the Community Notes X accountannouncedthe launch of a pilot test where select contributors would be able to rate posts by answering questions about why they either like or don\u2019t like that particular post. The system is similar to how Community Notes fact-checking works. Instead of simply allowing users to upvote or downvote posts for accuracy \u2014 something that could be easily gamed if like-minded contributors teamed up to promote their own views \u2014 Community Notes uses something called a \u201cbridging algorithm.\u201d This attempts to find consensus among people who don\u2019t usually share the same views. If users whose opinions typically differ both agree that a fact-check is accurate, the note is published and made visible to the public. While X\u2019s system has been criticized for being too slow and unable to keep up with the massive amounts of misinformation that circulate on the platform, this same idea has sincebeen adopted by Metaas a replacement for fact-checking. Now X intends to see if Community Notes could help identify the best posts, too. Starting today, the company says that a subset of Community Notes contributors will begin seeing a new callout in the product when a post is gaining attention in the form of Likes. Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives. In aposton the Community Notes X account, the company explains the experiment could bring awareness to \u201cwhat resonates broadly.\u201d \u201cPeople often feel the world is divided, yet Community Notes shows people can agree, even on contentious topics. This experimental new feature seeks to uncover ideas, insights, and opinions that bridge perspectives,\u201d the post states. \u201cFollowing the path we used to develop Community Notes, we\u2019re building in public with a small pilot so that this concept can be shaped by the people.

For about six months, Thorpe was a prolific volunteer contributor to an open source project led by database companyTurso. His work was impressive enough that Turso\u2019s CEO,Glauber Costa, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer. \u201cI checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,\u201d Costa told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a story I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dIt\u2019s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he hasworked full-timefrom his cell at a venture-funded, San Francisco-based startup since May. \u201cI reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,\u201d Costa said. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today\u00a0\u2026Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.\u201d Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative. Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later. \u201cI was a complete idiot,\u201d Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. \u201cI had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.\u201d Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew. \u201cWhen I came to Maine, it was completely different,\u201d he reminisced. \u201cCOVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance \u2014 there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it\u2019s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: \u2018I\u2019m going to make something of myself.\u2019\u201d At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe enrolled remotely at the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk. \u201cAfter consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cHis students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.\u201d Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support. \u201cMaine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,\u201d Haley Shoaf, co-executive director ofUnlocked Labs, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons. \u201c[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,\u201d Shoaf said. Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift. \u201cWhen I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cI began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.\u201d While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison \u2014 the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child \u2014 Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like. \u201cI have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cWhen they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, \u2018If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.\u2019\u201d The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners\u2019 return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it\u2019s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cMany states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% \u2014 you don\u2019t come back at all.\u201d Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum-security prison in Maine saw only seven assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017. \u201cWhen you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,\u201d Shoaf said. Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty\u2019s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man. \u201cIt\u2019s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cAll the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn\u2019t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.\u201d Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming. \u201cHe was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,\u201d Costa said. In the open source community, where developers often can\u2019t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself \u2014 a Linux-obsessed engineer who\u2019s interested in relational databases \u2014 and not as a criminal. \u201cThe worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cLetting someone have a career gives you purpose.\u201d  Topics Senior Writer Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The release allows early adopters to get their hands on Apple\u2019s latest software before its wider public availability later this fall. The update represents the most notable visual transformation since iOS 7,featuring a \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d designthat offers a more transparent, glass-like feel to user interface elements, like buttons, screens, and in-app navigation and controls, among other things. Liquid Glass is integrated throughout iOS 26, including in key apps like Phone, Camera, Safari, Music, and others, as well as in notifications, theLock Screen, Control Center, and the Home Screen. The software update also includes an redesigned Lock Screen for iPhone and iPad with a 3D photo effect and dynamic clock and updated app icons, which users can now set to clear, too. In terms ofAI features, the new software brings alive translation featurethat translates conversations in real time, AI-powered shortcuts,poll suggestions in Messages, and an update to Visual Intelligence for conducting image searches as you browse. Other software versions, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26, have also adopted the Liquid Glass design. Here is a brief overview of all the new features being introduced. In addition to the glass aesthetic, iPhone users have several updates to be excited about, including adedicated gaming appthat serves as a new destination for playing and discovering games in one place. The Phone app is introducing a new Call Screening feature that prompts unknown callers to state their name and reason for calling before the recipient answers. Additionally, a Hold Assist feature will notify users when hold music ends, signaling that they can speak to a live agent. The app, along with Messages and FaceTime, will also support real-time live translations. In the Messages app, meanwhile, users can expect a feature that has AI-generated suggestions for polls. In addition, iOS 26 will bring updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, as well asimprovementsto Camera, Photos, Maps,and a range of other minor additions, including the ability to customize alarm snooze times. A big win for iPad users is that they\u2019ll experience a moreMac-like tablet. For example, iPadOS 16 is bringing the Preview app from macOS, which enables annotation on PDFs. Plus, a new windowing system that lets users adjust the size of web pages and apps, as well as manage multiple windows and tabs at once. One notable update formacOS 26involves Spotlight, which will employ AI to anticipate user searches and suggest actions based on frequently performed tasks or ongoing projects. Additionally, macOS is gaining Live Activities, allowing users to sync activities directly with their iPhones and access recent calls and contacts. One of the more significant features coming to the newwatchOSis Workout Buddy, a fitness assistant powered by Apple Intelligence that provides motivation using a generative AI voice during workouts, pointing out key moments like closing the Exercise ring for the day. Apple has also revamped the Workout app, introducing a helpful new option called Autoplay Media. This feature automatically starts playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Additionally, Apple Music can intelligently recommend the most suitable playlists for your workouts and will recall listening habits for each type of exercise. Another update is the automatic volume adjustment capability, which adjusts the volume of calls, timers, alarms, and Siri to match the surrounding sound levels, ideal for quiet places like libraries. Apple also introduced a new one-handed flick gesture that\u2019s designed to dismiss notifications, silence incoming calls, and return to the watch face, among other actions. Arguably, the most useful new feature coming to Apple\u2019s TV operating system is the ability to switch profiles seamlessly. Users can easily select their profile as soon as the Apple TV wakes from sleep, allowing them to quickly resume their viewing experience. Apple Music introduced a fun feature that enables users to use their iPhones as microphones for sing-alongs, complete with on-screen lyrics displayed on the TV. Multiple iPhones can connect at once, making it possible for friends and family to join in, queue songs, and even send emoji reactions. Additionally, new Contact Posters for FaceTime allow users to showcase customized photos and names, personalizing the experience. Another notable update includes the expansion of Live Captions to support translations in languages such as French, German, and Spanish.

Today, more than 20% of daters report using AI for things like crafting dating profiles or sparking conversations, per a recentMatch.com study. Some are taking it further by forming emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with AI companions. Millions of people around the world are using AI companions from companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI, including72% of U.S. teens. Some people have reportedfalling in love with more general LLMs like ChatGPT. For some, the trend of dating bots is dystopian and unhealthy, a real-life version of the movie \u201cHer\u201d and a signal that authentic love is being replaced by a tech company\u2019s code. For others, AI companions are a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy is increasingly hard to find. A recent study found thata quarter of young adultsthink AI relationships could soon replace human ones altogether. Love, it seems, is no longer strictly human. The question is: Should it be? Or can dating an AI be better than dating a human? That was the topic of discussion last month at an event I attended in New York City, hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. TechCrunch was given exclusive access to publish the full video (which includes me asking the debaters a question, because I\u2019m a reporter, and I can\u2019t help myself!). Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the \u201cOn with Kara Swisher\u201d podcast and is the current host of \u201cSmart Girl Dumb Questions.\u201d Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that \u201cAI is an exciting new form of connection \u2026 Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.\u201d Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled \u201cThe Intimate Animal.\u201d You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments. Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can\u2019t get in their human relationships. \u201cAI listens to you without its ego,\u201d Ha said. \u201cIt adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.\u201d She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to \u201cyour fallible ex or maybe your current partner.\u201d \u201cThe one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, \u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?\u201d Ha conceded that since AI doesn\u2019t have a consciousness, she isn\u2019t claiming that \u201cAI can authentically love us.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t have theexperienceof being loved by AI. Garcia countered that it\u2019s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that\u2019s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That\u2019s not \u201can honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,\u201d he argued. \u201cThis idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. \u201cI think if we\u2019re using it as a tool to build skills, yes \u2026 that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThe idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.\u201d According to a Match.comSingles in America study, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI. \u201cNow I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha\u2019s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it goes to my point, that they\u2019re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn\u2019t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.\u201d Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don\u2019t trust AI. \u201cAccording to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,\u201d Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGov poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions. \u201cA little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don\u2019t trust.\u201d Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships. \u201cThey are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,\u201d Ha said. \u201cI think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.\u201d AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through. But it\u2019s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we\u2019re in, many people have been feeling \u201ctouch starvation\u201d \u2014 a condition that happens when you don\u2019t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone. Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits. \u201cThe potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,\u201d Ha said. \u201cThe tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.\u201d Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors \u2014 especially if that\u2019s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI. That concern is not unfounded.Multiple studieshave shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, aremore likely to be sexually aggressivewith real-life partners. \u201cWork by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,\u201d Garcia said. He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners. \u201cWe have enough of that in society,\u201d he said. Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design. Of course, she made that comment before the White House released itsAI Action Plan, which says nothing about transparency \u2014 which many frontier AI companies are against \u2014 or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.

Earlier this week, the White House revealed that theU.S. and Indonesia agreed to the framework of a trade agreement. That follows a number of other trade agreements the U.S. has reached with other countries, includingChinaand theUnited Kingdom.The developments come after Trump on April 2 sent markets into turmoil, with his announcement of sweeping levies that he then pushed off.\"So far, the tariff strategy Trump is pursuing looks very inspired, generating serious income, resulting in major investments in the U.S. to avoid the tariffs, and has yet to cause the disruptions and inflation that the naysayers said were certain,\" said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. \"The stock market certainly reflects no fear of negative consequences.\"Wednesday's moves followa second straight dayconcluding at a high for the S&P 500.The run to new highs hassparked so-called animal spiritson Wall Street, with shares of small companies with brand names and questionable finances getting a bid higher.Kohl'ssurged on Tuesday, andGoProandKrispy Kremejumped on Wednesday.Investors are awaitingearningsfromAlphabetandTeslaexpected Wednesday after the bell.

Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing.

A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document. It says: \u201cPresident Macron has not participated in, nor is he the product of, any government mind control programmes.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d9bf7d2b-b834-4c19-8c66-8629e3046f24", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:48.302636", "sentiment_score": -0.7160000205039978, "symbol": "A"}

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:51.522664", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362, "symbol": "A"}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:53.125133", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Tom Hayes\u2019 conviction for Libor-rigging quashed by UK\u2019s highest court", "content": " Alistair Grayin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:54.643603", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922, "symbol": "A"}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes revenue from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year,  a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivery 337,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to block chip exports to China but lacks key details", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration wants its AI technology to be considered an industry leader both on home soil and abroad. But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post. If the folks behind the new event could help YC founders, they believe they can help founders who aren\u2019t part of the famed program \u2014 and on the cheap without giving up equity.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Macrons file US lawsuit over claims France\u2019s first lady was born male", "content": " Kaye Wigginsin New York,Leila Abboudin Paris andLauren Fedorin Washington PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte have filed a US defamation lawsuit against Candace Owens, a rightwing influencer and podcaster who has said France\u2019s first lady \u201cis in fact a man\u201d. The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware on Wednesday, accuses Owens of publishing \u201coutlandish, defamatory and far-fetched fictions\u201d, chief among them thatBrigitte Macronwas born male under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux. Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing. The suit is a rare case of a serving world leader personally suing an online influencer over their content, though it comes days after Donald TrumpsuedThe Wall Street Journal and its parent companies over a report of a letter that the US president allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document. It says: \u201cPresident Macron has not participated in, nor is he the product of, any government mind control programmes.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d9bf7d2b-b834-4c19-8c66-8629e3046f24", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:27.261187", "sentiment_score": -0.7160000205039978, "symbol": "A"}

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:30.658590", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity firms flip assets to themselves in record numbers", "content": " Antoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:32.212689", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Tom Hayes\u2019 conviction for Libor-rigging quashed by UK\u2019s highest court", "content": " Alistair Grayin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:33.764620", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922, "symbol": "A"}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. While Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariff\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future. \u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter. The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year,  a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivery 337,000 vehicles. Tesla said Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.)

The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post. If the folks behind the new event could help YC founders, they believe they can help founders who aren\u2019t part of the famed program \u2014 and on the cheap without giving up equity.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Macrons file US lawsuit over claims France\u2019s first lady was born male", "content": " Kaye Wigginsin New York,Leila Abboudin Paris andLauren Fedorin Washington PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte have filed a US defamation lawsuit against Candace Owens, a rightwing influencer and podcaster who has said France\u2019s first lady \u201cis in fact a man\u201d. The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware on Wednesday, accuses Owens of publishing \u201coutlandish, defamatory and far-fetched fictions\u201d, chief among them thatBrigitte Macronwas born male under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux. Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing. The suit is a rare case of a serving world leader personally suing an online influencer over their content, though it comes days after Donald TrumpsuedThe Wall Street Journal and its parent companies over a report of a letter that the US president allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d.

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:07.325068", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Private equity firms flip assets to themselves in record numbers", "content": " Antoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:08.867094", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Tom Hayes\u2019 conviction for Libor-rigging quashed by UK\u2019s highest court", "content": " Alistair Grayin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:10.400759", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922, "symbol": "A"}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. While Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future. \u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter. The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year, a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivered 337,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023.

(Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.)

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

Intelreported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue, as the company's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant cuts in chip factory construction. The stock ticked higher in extended trading.Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: Loss of 10 cents per share, adjusted.Revenue: $12.86 billion versus $11.92 billion estimatedIntel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, inthe year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not comparable to analyst estimates due to an $800 million impairment charge, \"related to excess tools with no identified re-use,\" the company said. That resulted in an EPS adjustment of about 20 cents.The report was Intel's second since Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March, promising to make the chipmaker's products competitive again, and to reduce bureaucracy and layers of management, including slashing staff in Oregon and California.In a memo to employees published on Thursday, Tan said that the first few months of his tenure had \"not been easy.\" He said that the company had \"completed the majority\" of its planned layoffs, amounting to 15% of the workforce, and that it plans to end the year with 75,000 employees. Intel previously said it was trying to reduce operating expenses by $17 billion in 2025.Intel shares are up about 13% this year as of Thursday's close after plummeting 60% in 2024, their worst year on record.Tan also announced several other spending cuts in the memo, particularly in the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and is still looking for a big customer to anchor the business.Intel said its foundry business had an operating loss of $3.17 billion on $4.4 billion in revenue.Tan said that Intel had cancelled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and will consolidate its testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. He added that the company would slow down the pace of its construction of a cutting-edge chip factory in Ohio, depending on market demand and if it can secure big customers for the facility.\"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon \u2013 without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote. \"In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.\"Tan wrote that the company's forthcoming chip manufacturing process, called 14A, will be built out based on confirmed customer commitments.\"There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,\" Tan wrote.The company's client computing group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, had $7.9 billion in sales, down 3% on an annual basis.Revenue in the data center group, which includes some AI chips but is mostly central processors for servers, rose 4% to $3.9 billion. Tan wrote in his memo that Intel wants to regain market share in data center chips, and is looking for a permanent leader for the business. Longtime rivalAdvanced Micro Deviceshas increasingly beenwinning server businessfrom cloud customers.Tan added he would personally review and approve all chip designs before they are taped out, which is the final step of the design process before a new chip is manufactured.WATCH:How U.S. companies are mitigating Trump tariffs with foreign trade zones", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/intel-intc-earnings-report-q2-2025.html", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:09:35.625466", "sentiment_score": -0.8683000206947327, "symbol": "A"}

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Tesla shares fall as Trump says he wants Musk to \u2018thrive\u2019", "content": " Stephen Morrisin San Francisco,Zehra Munirin New York andJoe Millerin Washington PublishedJuly 24 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Tesla shares fell sharply after the company warned of a \u201crough\u201d ride from Donald Trump\u2019s policies, even as the US president said he wanted the group\u2019s billionaire chief Elon Musk to \u201cTHRIVE\u201d. Shares in the electric vehicle maker fell 8 per cent on Thursday, extending their loss to 37 per cent from a peak in mid-December, a fall that has now wiped more than half a trillion dollars from its market value. On Wednesday evening Tesla reported that second-quarter profitdeclinedmore than a fifth on slowing car sales. Musk said that Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-EV and solar power policies would further hit the company\u2019s earnings. \u201cWe\u2019re in this weird transition period where we\u2019ll lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said on Wednesday. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Trump\u2019s tax and spend actputs at riskthe billions of dollars in annual profit that Tesla makes from selling regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The legislation also ends a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that has helped drive sales. Trump denied he was retaliating against Musk after their acrimonious political split, posting on Truth Social that he wanted \u201call businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\u201d \u201cEveryone is stating that I will destroy Elon\u2019s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government,\u201d the president said. \u201cThis is not so!\u201d Musk bankrolled Trump\u2019s campaign with more than $250mn last year and after the election spearheaded the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). His close relationship with Trump was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla but ended up alienating many left-leaning customers. After a tumultuous four months marked by clashes with Trump\u2019s cabinet, the world\u2019s richest man emerged as a leading critic of the administration\u2019s economic and trade policies, vowed to launch his own party and helped reignite speculation about the president\u2019s relationship with the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump in turn has suggested that the US government should turn Doge on Musk\u2019s empire, cancelling lucrative contracts for his companies that include SpaceX, its satellite broadband network Starlink and xAI. Tesla\u2019s adjusted net income fell to about $1.4bn for the second quarter, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn the previous year. Revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.7bn and its operating margin narrowed. \u201cThere was no attempt to sugar coat the market headwinds for EVs,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, adding that Tesla had to \u201ccross the chasm\u201d to the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, \u201cwhile absorbing slower volume, EV incentive elimination, tariffs and investing in new initiatives that may not make margins for years\u201d. Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Musk also renewed his threat to leave Tesla if he is not given more shares, after a Delaware judge struck down a pay package that would have been the largest in US history. If reinstated on appeal by Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court, the package would increase Musk\u2019s ownership of Tesla from just under 13 per cent to more than 20 per cent. \u201cThat is a major concern for me\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Musk warns \u2018rough quarters\u2019 ahead for Tesla after Trump cancels EV incentives", "content": " Stephen Morrisin San Francisco andKana Inagakiin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Tesla has warned of a further hit to revenue from Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-electric vehicle policies in the US president\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d, darkening the outlook as second-quarter profits fell by more than a fifth. Trump\u2019s signature fiscal legislation puts at risk a crucial source of profit for Tesla that had allowed the electric-vehicle maker to sell billions of dollars of regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The hit to Tesla from the president\u2019s policies \u2014 including the loss of EV and solar power incentives \u2014 has deepened chief executiveElon Musk\u2019s rift with Trump, pulling the world\u2019s richest man back into politics despite his promise to investors to refocus his attention on the electric-car maker. \u201cWe are in the transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Teslashares fell 8 per cent in early trading on Thursday following Musk\u2019s comments. They have fallen more 30 per cent from a peak in mid-December. The billionaire\u2019s close relationship with Trump, after supporting his re-election bid, was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla. However, Musk\u2019s role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alienated some customers as he celebrated brutal cuts to the federal workforce. He left the White House in May after falling out with the president, becoming a fierce critic of the Republican\u2019s spending bill and pledging tolaunch his own political party. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. A consumer backlash against Musk\u2019s political activities has contributed to a sales slump at Tesla, which is also suffering from an ageing model line-up and greater EV competition from Chinese and western rivals. The Austin, Texas-based company on Wednesday reported that its adjusted net income came in close to analysts\u2019 expectations at $1.4bn for the three months through June, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn a year earlier. The carmaker warned Trump\u2019s policies would add to its difficulties in the coming months. Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla had a limited supply of vehicles and might not be able to deliver enough cars in time to meet orders if consumers rushed to beat the September deadline for the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases and leases. Teslastands to losemuch of the income from the sale of its regulatory credits after Trump\u2019s bill eliminated fines for non-compliance, throwing the future of emissions trading programmes in doubt. Revenue from the credits almost halved to $439mn in the quarter from a year before. Last year, the company made $2.8bn from these sales. The bill also threatens Tesla\u2019s other business lines by removing a range of incentives for renewable energy. Taneja said Tesla faced $300mn in additional tariff-related costs in the second quarter and warned this figure would increase through the year. The US has imposed higher tariffs on foreign-sourced cars and components, including battery cells that Tesla imports from China. \u201cWhile we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front,\u201d he added. In an attempt to revive its sales momentum, the company said it would aim to begin mass production of its delayed affordable model during the second half of the year. Recommended Tesla\u2019s revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.5bn in the second quarter from a year earlier, close to the average $22.7bn analyst estimate, according to data from Visible Alpha. Its operating margin dropped to 4.1 per cent, from 6.3 per cent. Reported net income declined 16 per cent to $1.2bn. With the slide in its automotive revenue, Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service, which launched in Austin last month. Musk said the number of robotaxis in operation would increase at \u201ca hyper-exponential rate\u201d, making the ride-hailing service available to half of the US population by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Despite the release of an upgraded version of its flagship Model Y sport utility vehicle, Tesla\u2019s sales have continued to sag in big European markets. Recommended Musk said he expected sales to improve in Europe if and when Tesla gets regulatory approval for its \u201cfull self-driving\u201d technology, which he said could happen this year. Earlier this month, Tesladisclosedit had sold 384,122 vehicles in the quarter, below the 389,000 forecast by analysts and down 13 per cent from 443,956 in the same period last year. Barclays analyst Dan Levy said the result was \u201cpositive, with improved fundamentals and narrative intact\u201d. But he added \u201cthe volume outlook remains uncertain\u201d and Tesla did not give a forecast for the number of cars it would build, as investors had expected. Tesla scrapped its guidance in April, blaming economic uncertainty from tariffs.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/756a5bee-ca40-4dce-8d31-e738af1d989f", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:10:00.630157", "sentiment_score": -0.9546999931335449, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Judge rejects Trump administration\u2019s request to unseal Epstein documents", "content": " Stefania PalmaandLauren Fedorin Washington PublishedJuly 24 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world A US federal judge has rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to unseal grand jury transcripts linked to Jeffrey Epstein, as the White House battles to contain the fallout over files linked to the late paedophile financier. District judge Robin Rosenberg on Wednesday argued that district courts did not have the power to release the records except in rare circumstances, and said the government\u2019s request was \u201cnot based on any of the exceptions\u201d to a federal rule governing the secrecy of grand jury files. The decision by the Florida judge came after Trump last week directed US attorney-general Pam Bondito unseal grand jury transcriptslinked to the financier, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The administration has faced weeks of mounting pressure over the Epstein case, which hasexposed fissuresin the president\u2019s Maga movement after he reneged on a campaign promise to make public files relating to the disgraced financier. A memo published by the justice department and FBI this month said there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that Epstein \u201cblackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions\u201d and that a \u201cclient list\u201d did not exist. That sparked outrage from some of the loudest voices in the Maga movement, many of whom called for Bondi to resign.Trumphas stood by his attorney-general. But the president faced fresh questions about his links to Epstein on Wednesday, when US media reported that Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche informed Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. Earlier this month, the president was asked by a reporter at the White House whether Bondi had told him that his name appeared in the files. He replied: \u201cNo, she has given us just a very quick briefing, and in terms of the credibility of the different things that they have seen.\u201d Trump has previously said he was Epstein\u2019s friend for 15 years, but claimed the two had a falling out more than 20 years ago. Recommended The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling in Florida. A Manhattan federal court is considering separate motions to unseal grand jury transcripts and a judge has asked the government for \u201cadditional submissions\u201d before ruling on whether to grant the request. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Bondi and Blanche stood by the memo from earlier this month, adding: \u201cNothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009as part of our routine briefing, we made the president aware of the findings.\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung said Trump kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club \u201cfor being a creep\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ef1ca342-28fa-4d02-9046-8495bded31ce", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:10:02.205487", "sentiment_score": -0.8029999732971191, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Zelenskyy signals retreat from power grab after mass protests in Ukraine", "content": " Christopher Millerin Kyiv PublishedJuly 24 2025 UpdatedJuly 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to soften his stance on bringing the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies under executive control on Thursday, approving a new bill that he said would guarantee the agencies\u2019 independence after taking advice from the UK prime minister.Zelenskyy said the bill would be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament. He said earlier he had discussed the legislation with British premier Sir Keir Starmer, who \u201csuggested involving experts who could contribute to long-term co-operation on anti-corruption initiatives\u2019\u2019.Zelenskyy\u2019s statement and his call with Starmer came after the Ukrainian leader\u2019s push to subordinate the agencies to his handpicked prosecutor-general sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The move was condemned by the EU and G7 members, while critics accused Zelenskyy of an authoritarian power grab.It remains unclear how far the new bill will go towards restoring full independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Sapo).Ukrainians\u2019 frustration with the president has boiled over amid a deepening political crisis of his own making. Protests in Kyiv on Wednesday involved roughly 10,000 demonstrators \u2014 more than triple the previous day \u2014 who shouted \u201cshame\u201d and demanded that Zelenskyy \u201cveto the law\u201d. Thousands more turned out in other cities including Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa. \u201cEveryone has heard what people are saying,\u2019\u2019 Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday night address to the nation, seeking to assuage public concern. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not falling on deaf ears.\u201dYaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition MP who was among those who voted against the law, said on Thursday that he and 47 other lawmakers had submitted a draft law to revoke the amendments embedded in the earlier one that limited the powers of Nabu and Sapo. The president said his push to put the prosecutor-general, whom he appointed, in charge of Nabu and Sapo was aimed at rooting out Russian spies.The protests against the decision have been some of the biggest since the 2014 Euromaidan uprising that set Ukraine on a western course. Soldiers said they had been ordered by military leaders to avoid attending the protests and to refrain from posting criticism on social media. But many still came out in uniform to protest in Kyiv. One veteran and double-amputee at a rally near the president\u2019s office held a sign that read: \u201cWe are fighting for Ukraine, not your impunity.\u201d The criticism of Zelenskyy has been scathing, marking an unprecedented shift in Ukraine\u2019s wartime discourse. Since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, many Ukrainians had largely refrained from public dissent to prioritise national unity, but that consensus is now showing signs of strain.Critics said the original law, rushed through parliament with unusual speed and secrecy, resembled infamous \u201cdictatorship laws\u201d from 2014 that gave pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych extraordinary powers. Nabu and Sapo welcomed Zelenskyy\u2019s revised version of the bill and said it restored \u201call procedural powers and guarantees of the independence of Nabu and Sapo\u201d. They said in a statement: \u201cNabu and Sapo participated in the preparation of the text and urge the Verkhovna Rada to adopt the president\u2019s initiative as a basis and in full as soon as possible. This will help prevent threats to criminal proceedings investigated by Nabu and Sapo.\u201dIn Washington, before Zelenskyy\u2019s latest concessions, Democrat senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican senator Lindsey Graham published a statement on Wednesday praising the \u201cenormous strides\u201d Ukraine had made on anti-corruption since 2014 despite Russia\u2019s aggression. But they added, \u201cwe fear [the new law] undermines much of that progress\u2019\u2019. The situation has unfolded as Russian forces gain territory in Ukraine at their fastest pace in more than a year and the air war escalates. Russian drone strikes overnight in the historic centre of Odesa injured at least four people, according to regional governor Oleh Kiper. The attack came hours after a third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul ended without significant progress towards ending the war. The Kremlin on Thursday said it did not see how Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy could meet before the end of August. Zelenskyy has said the issues\u00a0central to ending the largest armed conflict on European soil in generations could only be settled in a face-to-face meeting between himself and Putin.

On Thursday, the Community Notes X accountannouncedthe launch of a pilot test where select contributors would be able to rate posts by answering questions about why they either like or don\u2019t like that particular post. The system is similar to how Community Notes fact-checking works. Instead of simply allowing users to upvote or downvote posts for accuracy \u2014 something that could be easily gamed if like-minded contributors teamed up to promote their own views \u2014 Community Notes uses something called a \u201cbridging algorithm.\u201d This attempts to find consensus among people who don\u2019t usually share the same views. If users whose opinions typically differ both agree that a fact-check is accurate, the note is published and made visible to the public. While X\u2019s system has been criticized for being too slow and unable to keep up with the massive amounts of misinformation that circulate on the platform, this same idea has sincebeen adopted by Metaas a replacement for fact-checking. Now X intends to see if Community Notes could help identify the best posts, too. Starting today, the company says that a subset of Community Notes contributors will begin seeing a new callout in the product when a post is gaining attention in the form of Likes. Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives. In aposton the Community Notes X account, the company explains the experiment could bring awareness to \u201cwhat resonates broadly.\u201d \u201cPeople often feel the world is divided, yet Community Notes shows people can agree, even on contentious topics. This experimental new feature seeks to uncover ideas, insights, and opinions that bridge perspectives,\u201d the post states. \u201cFollowing the path we used to develop Community Notes, we\u2019re building in public with a small pilot so that this concept can be shaped by the people. We look forward to learning and iterating with you all as we do with Community Notes every day.\u201d  Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Preston Thorpe is a software engineer at a San Francisco startup \u2014 he\u2019s also serving his 11th year in prison", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us If you omit some key details, all Preston Thorpe has to do to become a senior software engineer at a promising tech company is walk through the door. For about six months, Thorpe was a prolific volunteer contributor to an open source project led by database companyTurso. His work was impressive enough that Turso\u2019s CEO,Glauber Costa, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer. \u201cI checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,\u201d Costa told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a story I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dIt\u2019s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he hasworked full-timefrom his cell at a venture-funded, San Francisco-based startup since May. \u201cI reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,\u201d Costa said. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today\u00a0\u2026Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.\u201d Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative. Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later. \u201cI was a complete idiot,\u201d Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. \u201cI had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.\u201d Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew. \u201cWhen I came to Maine, it was completely different,\u201d he reminisced. \u201cCOVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance \u2014 there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it\u2019s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: \u2018I\u2019m going to make something of myself.\u2019\u201d At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe enrolled remotely at the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk. \u201cAfter consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cHis students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.\u201d Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support. \u201cMaine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,\u201d Haley Shoaf, co-executive director ofUnlocked Labs, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons. \u201c[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,\u201d Shoaf said. Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift. \u201cWhen I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cI began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.\u201d While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison \u2014 the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child \u2014 Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like. \u201cI have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cWhen they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, \u2018If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.\u2019\u201d The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners\u2019 return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it\u2019s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cMany states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% \u2014 you don\u2019t come back at all.\u201d Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum-security prison in Maine saw only seven assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017. \u201cWhen you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,\u201d Shoaf said. Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty\u2019s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man. \u201cIt\u2019s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cAll the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn\u2019t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.\u201d Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming. \u201cHe was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,\u201d Costa said. In the open source community, where developers often can\u2019t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself \u2014 a Linux-obsessed engineer who\u2019s interested in relational databases \u2014 and not as a criminal. \u201cThe worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cLetting someone have a career gives you purpose.\u201d  Topics Senior Writer Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Apple has also revamped the Workout app, introducing a helpful new option called Autoplay Media. This feature automatically starts playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Additionally, Apple Music can intelligently recommend the most suitable playlists for your workouts and will recall listening habits for each type of exercise. Another update is the automatic volume adjustment capability, which adjusts the volume of calls, timers, alarms, and Siri to match the surrounding sound levels, ideal for quiet places like libraries. Apple also introduced a new one-handed flick gesture that\u2019s designed to dismiss notifications, silence incoming calls, and return to the watch face, among other actions. Arguably, the most useful new feature coming to Apple\u2019s TV operating system is the ability to switch profiles seamlessly. Users can easily select their profile as soon as the Apple TV wakes from sleep, allowing them to quickly resume their viewing experience. Apple Music introduced a fun feature that enables users to use their iPhones as microphones for sing-alongs, complete with on-screen lyrics displayed on the TV. Multiple iPhones can connect at once, making it possible for friends and family to join in, queue songs, and even send emoji reactions.

Today, more than 20% of daters report using AI for things like crafting dating profiles or sparking conversations, per a recentMatch.com study. Some are taking it further by forming emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with AI companions. Millions of people around the world are using AI companions from companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI, including72% of U.S. teens. Some people have reportedfalling in love with more general LLMs like ChatGPT. For some, the trend of dating bots is dystopian and unhealthy, a real-life version of the movie \u201cHer\u201d and a signal that authentic love is being replaced by a tech company\u2019s code. For others, AI companions are a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy is increasingly hard to find. A recent study found thata quarter of young adultsthink AI relationships could soon replace human ones altogether. Love, it seems, is no longer strictly human. The question is: Should it be? Or can dating an AI be better than dating a human? That was the topic of discussion last month at an event I attended in New York City, hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. TechCrunch was given exclusive access to publish the full video (which includes me asking the debaters a question, because I\u2019m a reporter, and I can\u2019t help myself!). Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the \u201cOn with Kara Swisher\u201d podcast and is the current host of \u201cSmart Girl Dumb Questions.\u201d Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that \u201cAI is an exciting new form of connection \u2026 Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.\u201d Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled \u201cThe Intimate Animal.\u201d You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments. Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can\u2019t get in their human relationships. \u201cAI listens to you without its ego,\u201d Ha said. \u201cIt adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.\u201d She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to \u201cyour fallible ex or maybe your current partner.\u201d \u201cThe one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, \u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?\u201d Ha conceded that since AI doesn\u2019t have a consciousness, she isn\u2019t claiming that \u201cAI can authentically love us.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t have theexperienceof being loved by AI. Garcia countered that it\u2019s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that\u2019s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That\u2019s not \u201can honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,\u201d he argued. \u201cThis idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. \u201cI think if we\u2019re using it as a tool to build skills, yes \u2026 that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThe idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.\u201d According to a Match.comSingles in America study, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI. \u201cNow I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha\u2019s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it goes to my point, that they\u2019re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn\u2019t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.\u201d Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don\u2019t trust AI. \u201cAccording to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,\u201d Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGov poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions. \u201cA little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don\u2019t trust.\u201d Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships. \u201cThey are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,\u201d Ha said. \u201cI think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.\u201d AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through. But it\u2019s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we\u2019re in, many people have been feeling \u201ctouch starvation\u201d \u2014 a condition that happens when you don\u2019t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone. Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits. \u201cThe potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,\u201d Ha said. \u201cThe tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.\u201d Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors \u2014 especially if that\u2019s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI. That concern is not unfounded.Multiple studieshave shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, aremore likely to be sexually aggressivewith real-life partners. \u201cWork by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,\u201d Garcia said. He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners. \u201cWe have enough of that in society,\u201d he said. Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design. Of course, she made that comment before the White House released itsAI Action Plan, which says nothing about transparency \u2014 which many frontier AI companies are against \u2014 or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.

Intelreported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue, as the company's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant cuts in chip factory construction. The stock ticked higher in extended trading.Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: Loss of 10 cents per share, adjusted.Revenue: $12.86 billion versus $11.92 billion estimatedIntel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, inthe year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not comparable to analyst estimates due to an $800 million impairment charge, \"related to excess tools with no identified re-use,\" the company said. That resulted in an EPS adjustment of about 20 cents.The report was Intel's second since Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March, promising to make the chipmaker's products competitive again, and to reduce bureaucracy and layers of management, including slashing staff in Oregon and California.In a memo to employees published on Thursday, Tan said that the first few months of his tenure had \"not been easy.\" He said that the company had \"completed the majority\" of its planned layoffs, amounting to 15% of the workforce, and that it plans to end the year with 75,000 employees. Intel previously said it was trying to reduce operating expenses by $17 billion in 2025.Intel shares are up about 13% this year as of Thursday's close after plummeting 60% in 2024, their worst year on record.Tan also announced several other spending cuts in the memo, particularly in the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and is still looking for a big customer to anchor the business.Intel said its foundry business had an operating loss of $3.17 billion on $4.4 billion in revenue.Tan said that Intel had cancelled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and will consolidate its testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. He added that the company would slow down the pace of its construction of a cutting-edge chip factory in Ohio, depending on market demand and if it can secure big customers for the facility.\"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon \u2013 without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote. \"In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.\"Tan wrote that the company's forthcoming chip manufacturing process, called 14A, will be built out based on confirmed customer commitments.\"There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,\" Tan wrote.The company's client computing group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, had $7.9 billion in sales, down 3% on an annual basis.Revenue in the data center group, which includes some AI chips but is mostly central processors for servers, rose 4% to $3.9 billion. Tan wrote in his memo that Intel wants to regain market share in data center chips, and is looking for a permanent leader for the business. Longtime rivalAdvanced Micro Deviceshas increasingly beenwinning server businessfrom cloud customers.Tan added he would personally review and approve all chip designs before they are taped out, which is the final step of the design process before a new chip is manufactured.WATCH:How U.S. companies are mitigating Trump tariffs with foreign trade zones", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/intel-intc-earnings-report-q2-2025.html", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:40:22.827993", "sentiment_score": -0.8683000206947327, "symbol": "A"}

Shares in the electric vehicle maker fell 8 per cent on Thursday, extending their loss to 37 per cent from a peak in mid-December, a fall that has now wiped more than half a trillion dollars from its market value. On Wednesday evening Tesla reported that second-quarter profitdeclinedmore than a fifth on slowing car sales. Musk said that Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-EV and solar power policies would further hit the company\u2019s earnings. \u201cWe\u2019re in this weird transition period where we\u2019ll lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said on Wednesday. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Trump\u2019s tax and spend actputs at riskthe billions of dollars in annual profit that Tesla makes from selling regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The legislation also ends a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that has helped drive sales. Trump denied he was retaliating against Musk after their acrimonious political split, posting on Truth Social that he wanted \u201call businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\u201d \u201cEveryone is stating that I will destroy Elon\u2019s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government,\u201d the president said. \u201cThis is not so!\u201d Musk bankrolled Trump\u2019s campaign with more than $250mn last year and after the election spearheaded the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). His close relationship with Trump was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla but ended up alienating many left-leaning customers. After a tumultuous four months marked by clashes with Trump\u2019s cabinet, the world\u2019s richest man emerged as a leading critic of the administration\u2019s economic and trade policies, vowed to launch his own party and helped reignite speculation about the president\u2019s relationship with the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump in turn has suggested that the US government should turn Doge on Musk\u2019s empire, cancelling lucrative contracts for his companies that include SpaceX, its satellite broadband network Starlink and xAI. Tesla\u2019s adjusted net income fell to about $1.4bn for the second quarter, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn the previous year. Revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.7bn and its operating margin narrowed. \u201cThere was no attempt to sugar coat the market headwinds for EVs,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, adding that Tesla had to \u201ccross the chasm\u201d to the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, \u201cwhile absorbing slower volume, EV incentive elimination, tariffs and investing in new initiatives that may not make margins for years\u201d. Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Musk also renewed his threat to leave Tesla if he is not given more shares, after a Delaware judge struck down a pay package that would have been the largest in US history. If reinstated on appeal by Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court, the package would increase Musk\u2019s ownership of Tesla from just under 13 per cent to more than 20 per cent. \u201cThat is a major concern for me\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

Tesla has warned of a further hit to revenue from Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-electric vehicle policies in the US president\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d, darkening the outlook as second-quarter profits fell by more than a fifth. Trump\u2019s signature fiscal legislation puts at risk a crucial source of profit for Tesla that had allowed the electric-vehicle maker to sell billions of dollars of regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The hit to Tesla from the president\u2019s policies \u2014 including the loss of EV and solar power incentives \u2014 has deepened chief executiveElon Musk\u2019s rift with Trump, pulling the world\u2019s richest man back into politics despite his promise to investors to refocus his attention on the electric-car maker. \u201cWe are in the transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Teslashares fell 8 per cent in early trading on Thursday following Musk\u2019s comments. They have fallen more 30 per cent from a peak in mid-December. The billionaire\u2019s close relationship with Trump, after supporting his re-election bid, was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla. However, Musk\u2019s role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alienated some customers as he celebrated brutal cuts to the federal workforce. He left the White House in May after falling out with the president, becoming a fierce critic of the Republican\u2019s spending bill and pledging tolaunch his own political party. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. A consumer backlash against Musk\u2019s political activities has contributed to a sales slump at Tesla, which is also suffering from an ageing model line-up and greater EV competition from Chinese and western rivals. The Austin, Texas-based company on Wednesday reported that its adjusted net income came in close to analysts\u2019 expectations at $1.4bn for the three months through June, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn a year earlier. The carmaker warned Trump\u2019s policies would add to its difficulties in the coming months. Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla had a limited supply of vehicles and might not be able to deliver enough cars in time to meet orders if consumers rushed to beat the September deadline for the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases and leases. Teslastands to losemuch of the income from the sale of its regulatory credits after Trump\u2019s bill eliminated fines for non-compliance, throwing the future of emissions trading programmes in doubt. Revenue from the credits almost halved to $439mn in the quarter from a year before. Last year, the company made $2.8bn from these sales. The bill also threatens Tesla\u2019s other business lines by removing a range of incentives for renewable energy. Taneja said Tesla faced $300mn in additional tariff-related costs in the second quarter and warned this figure would increase through the year. The US has imposed higher tariffs on foreign-sourced cars and components, including battery cells that Tesla imports from China. \u201cWhile we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front,\u201d he added. In an attempt to revive its sales momentum, the company said it would aim to begin mass production of its delayed affordable model during the second half of the year. Recommended Tesla\u2019s revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.5bn in the second quarter from a year earlier, close to the average $22.7bn analyst estimate, according to data from Visible Alpha. Its operating margin dropped to 4.1 per cent, from 6.3 per cent. Reported net income declined 16 per cent to $1.2bn. With the slide in its automotive revenue, Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service, which launched in Austin last month. Musk said the number of robotaxis in operation would increase at \u201ca hyper-exponential rate\u201d, making the ride-hailing service available to half of the US population by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Despite the release of an upgraded version of its flagship Model Y sport utility vehicle, Tesla\u2019s sales have continued to sag in big European markets. Recommended Musk said he expected sales to improve in Europe if and when Tesla gets regulatory approval for its \u201cfull self-driving\u201d technology, which he said could happen this year. Earlier this month, Tesladisclosedit had sold 384,122 vehicles in the quarter, below the 389,000 forecast by analysts and down 13 per cent from 443,956 in the same period last year. Barclays analyst Dan Levy said the result was \u201cpositive, with improved fundamentals and narrative intact\u201d. But he added \u201cthe volume outlook remains uncertain\u201d and Tesla did not give a forecast for the number of cars it would build, as investors had expected. Tesla scrapped its guidance in April, blaming economic uncertainty from tariffs.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/756a5bee-ca40-4dce-8d31-e738af1d989f", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:40:47.918133", "sentiment_score": -0.9546999931335449, "symbol": "A"}

Top administration officials have accused Fed chair Jay Powell of \u201cgrossly\u201d mismanaging the project. Budget director Russell Vought and Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2014 who are among the Trump administration\u2019s most vocal opponents of Powell \u2014 are set to join the president on the visit. Trump said on Thursday afternoon that Powell would also be present. Presidential delegations to the US central bank, which was granted independence to set interest rates as it sees fit in 1951, are rare. The Supreme Court has signalled that the White House cannot firePowellor any of the Fed\u2019s other six governors over disputes over monetary policy. The president has lashed out repeatedly at the Fed and Powell, who he has called a \u201cnumbskull\u201d, for declining to reduce interest rates this year. Trump on Wednesday insisted the cental bank should slash borrowing costs to about 1 per cent \u2014 a level typically associated with economic crises \u2014 from the current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent. Trump ignited a steep drop in the dollar last week when heasked lawmakerswhether he should fire Powell. He later said he did not plan on making such a move, but investors said even asking the question had inflamed concerns over central bank independence. Some Fed insiders and former central bank officials are concerned the attacks are being used by the administration as a pretext to pile pressure on Powell to quit before his term as chair ends in May 2026, or even fire him \u201cfor cause\u201d \u2014 a term usually interpreted as malfeasance. Recommended The Fed chair is adamant that he will remain in place and believes Trump does not have the legal grounds to dismiss him. \u201cIdeas of Powell needing to step down in order to preserve independence don\u2019t make a lot of sense to us,\u201d Ivascyn said. \u201cWe think a good independent Fed chair would finish the term, and then determine what to do next.\u201d \u201cFrom a bond market perspective, it\u2019s important to continue to see positive signals that he can finish his term,\u201d he added.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fdcc22e9-b86d-4d4b-a919-99c18cf324e2", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:40:49.361913", "sentiment_score": -0.8300999999046326, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Zelenskyy signals retreat from power grab after mass protests in Ukraine", "content": " Christopher Millerin Kyiv PublishedJuly 24 2025 UpdatedJuly 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to soften his stance on bringing the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies under executive control on Thursday, approving a new bill that he said would guarantee the agencies\u2019 independence after taking advice from the UK prime minister.Zelenskyy said the bill would be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament. He said earlier he had discussed the legislation with British premier Sir Keir Starmer, who \u201csuggested involving experts who could contribute to long-term co-operation on anti-corruption initiatives\u2019\u2019.Zelenskyy\u2019s statement and his call with Starmer came after the Ukrainian leader\u2019s push to subordinate the agencies to his handpicked prosecutor-general sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The move was condemned by the EU and G7 members, while critics accused Zelenskyy of an authoritarian power grab.It remains unclear how far the new bill will go towards restoring full independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Sapo).Ukrainians\u2019 frustration with the president has boiled over amid a deepening political crisis of his own making. Protests in Kyiv on Wednesday involved roughly 10,000 demonstrators \u2014 more than triple the previous day \u2014 who shouted \u201cshame\u201d and demanded that Zelenskyy \u201cveto the law\u201d. Thousands more turned out in other cities including Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa. \u201cEveryone has heard what people are saying,\u2019\u2019 Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday night address to the nation, seeking to assuage public concern. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not falling on deaf ears.\u201dYaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition MP who was among those who voted against the law, said on Thursday that he and 47 other lawmakers had submitted a draft law to revoke the amendments embedded in the earlier one that limited the powers of Nabu and Sapo. The president said his push to put the prosecutor-general, whom he appointed, in charge of Nabu and Sapo was aimed at rooting out Russian spies.The protests against the decision have been some of the biggest since the 2014 Euromaidan uprising that set Ukraine on a western course. Soldiers said they had been ordered by military leaders to avoid attending the protests and to refrain from posting criticism on social media. But many still came out in uniform to protest in Kyiv. One veteran and double-amputee at a rally near the president\u2019s office held a sign that read: \u201cWe are fighting for Ukraine, not your impunity.\u201d The criticism of Zelenskyy has been scathing, marking an unprecedented shift in Ukraine\u2019s wartime discourse. Since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, many Ukrainians had largely refrained from public dissent to prioritise national unity, but that consensus is now showing signs of strain.Critics said the original law, rushed through parliament with unusual speed and secrecy, resembled infamous \u201cdictatorship laws\u201d from 2014 that gave pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych extraordinary powers. Nabu and Sapo welcomed Zelenskyy\u2019s revised version of the bill and said it restored \u201call procedural powers and guarantees of the independence of Nabu and Sapo\u201d. They said in a statement: \u201cNabu and Sapo participated in the preparation of the text and urge the Verkhovna Rada to adopt the president\u2019s initiative as a basis and in full as soon as possible. This will help prevent threats to criminal proceedings investigated by Nabu and Sapo.\u201dIn Washington, before Zelenskyy\u2019s latest concessions, Democrat senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican senator Lindsey Graham published a statement on Wednesday praising the \u201cenormous strides\u201d Ukraine had made on anti-corruption since 2014 despite Russia\u2019s aggression. But they added, \u201cwe fear [the new law] undermines much of that progress\u2019\u2019. The situation has unfolded as Russian forces gain territory in Ukraine at their fastest pace in more than a year and the air war escalates. Russian drone strikes overnight in the historic centre of Odesa injured at least four people, according to regional governor Oleh Kiper. The attack came hours after a third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul ended without significant progress towards ending the war. The Kremlin on Thursday said it did not see how Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy could meet before the end of August. Zelenskyy has said the issues\u00a0central to ending the largest armed conflict on European soil in generations could only be settled in a face-to-face meeting between himself and Putin.

On Thursday, the Community Notes X accountannouncedthe launch of a pilot test where select contributors would be able to rate posts by answering questions about why they either like or don\u2019t like that particular post. The system is similar to how Community Notes fact-checking works. Instead of simply allowing users to upvote or downvote posts for accuracy \u2014 something that could be easily gamed if like-minded contributors teamed up to promote their own views \u2014 Community Notes uses something called a \u201cbridging algorithm.\u201d This attempts to find consensus among people who don\u2019t usually share the same views. If users whose opinions typically differ both agree that a fact-check is accurate, the note is published and made visible to the public. While X\u2019s system has been criticized for being too slow and unable to keep up with the massive amounts of misinformation that circulate on the platform, this same idea has sincebeen adopted by Metaas a replacement for fact-checking. Now X intends to see if Community Notes could help identify the best posts, too. Starting today, the company says that a subset of Community Notes contributors will begin seeing a new callout in the product when a post is gaining attention in the form of Likes. Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives. In aposton the Community Notes X account, the company explains the experiment could bring awareness to \u201cwhat resonates broadly.\u201d \u201cPeople often feel the world is divided, yet Community Notes shows people can agree, even on contentious topics. This experimental new feature seeks to uncover ideas, insights, and opinions that bridge perspectives,\u201d the post states. \u201cFollowing the path we used to develop Community Notes, we\u2019re building in public with a small pilot so that this concept can be shaped by the people. We look forward to learning and iterating with you all as we do with Community Notes every day.\u201d  Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Preston Thorpe is a software engineer at a San Francisco startup \u2014 he\u2019s also serving his 11th year in prison", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us If you omit some key details, all Preston Thorpe has to do to become a senior software engineer at a promising tech company is walk through the door. For about six months, Thorpe was a prolific volunteer contributor to an open source project led by database companyTurso. His work was impressive enough that Turso\u2019s CEO,Glauber Costa, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer. \u201cI checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,\u201d Costa told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a story I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dIt\u2019s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he hasworked full-timefrom his cell at a venture-funded, San Francisco-based startup since May. \u201cI reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,\u201d Costa said. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today\u00a0\u2026Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.\u201d Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative. Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later. \u201cI was a complete idiot,\u201d Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. \u201cI had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.\u201d Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew. \u201cWhen I came to Maine, it was completely different,\u201d he reminisced. \u201cCOVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance \u2014 there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it\u2019s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: \u2018I\u2019m going to make something of myself.\u2019\u201d At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe enrolled remotely at the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk. \u201cAfter consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cHis students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.\u201d Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support. \u201cMaine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,\u201d Haley Shoaf, co-executive director ofUnlocked Labs, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons. \u201c[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,\u201d Shoaf said. Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift. \u201cWhen I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cI began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.\u201d While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison \u2014 the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child \u2014 Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like. \u201cI have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cWhen they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, \u2018If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.\u2019\u201d The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners\u2019 return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it\u2019s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cMany states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% \u2014 you don\u2019t come back at all.\u201d Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum-security prison in Maine saw only seven assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017. \u201cWhen you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,\u201d Shoaf said. Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty\u2019s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man. \u201cIt\u2019s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cAll the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn\u2019t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.\u201d Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming. \u201cHe was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,\u201d Costa said. In the open source community, where developers often can\u2019t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself \u2014 a Linux-obsessed engineer who\u2019s interested in relational databases \u2014 and not as a criminal. \u201cThe worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cLetting someone have a career gives you purpose.\u201d  Topics Senior Writer Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the \u201cOn with Kara Swisher\u201d podcast and is the current host of \u201cSmart Girl Dumb Questions.\u201d Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that \u201cAI is an exciting new form of connection \u2026 Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.\u201d Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled \u201cThe Intimate Animal.\u201d You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments. Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can\u2019t get in their human relationships. \u201cAI listens to you without its ego,\u201d Ha said. \u201cIt adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.\u201d She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to \u201cyour fallible ex or maybe your current partner.\u201d \u201cThe one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, \u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?\u201d Ha conceded that since AI doesn\u2019t have a consciousness, she isn\u2019t claiming that \u201cAI can authentically love us.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t have theexperienceof being loved by AI. Garcia countered that it\u2019s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that\u2019s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That\u2019s not \u201can honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,\u201d he argued. \u201cThis idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. \u201cI think if we\u2019re using it as a tool to build skills, yes \u2026 that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThe idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.\u201d According to a Match.comSingles in America study, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI. \u201cNow I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha\u2019s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it goes to my point, that they\u2019re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn\u2019t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.\u201d Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don\u2019t trust AI. \u201cAccording to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,\u201d Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGov poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions. \u201cA little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don\u2019t trust.\u201d Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships. \u201cThey are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,\u201d Ha said. \u201cI think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.\u201d AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through. But it\u2019s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we\u2019re in, many people have been feeling \u201ctouch starvation\u201d \u2014 a condition that happens when you don\u2019t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone. Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits. \u201cThe potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,\u201d Ha said. \u201cThe tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.\u201d Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors \u2014 especially if that\u2019s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI. That concern is not unfounded.Multiple studieshave shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, aremore likely to be sexually aggressivewith real-life partners. \u201cWork by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,\u201d Garcia said. He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners. \u201cWe have enough of that in society,\u201d he said. Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design. Of course, she made that comment before the White House released itsAI Action Plan, which says nothing about transparency \u2014 which many frontier AI companies are against \u2014 or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs maydiminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S.relative their peers in the region.\u2013 Amala BalakrishnerIn the marketsIndian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.Both the benchmarkNifty 50and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:45:00.675916", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "A"}

The investment includes $2.5 billion to fund a domestic iPhone glass factory.Trump also announced Wednesday he would impose a100% tariff on imports of semiconductorsand chips \u2014 except for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"\"We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,\" Trump said in the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"But the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,\" he said.The announcements boosted theNasdaq Compositeon Thursday, with the tech-heavy index closing up 0.35% even as the other major indexesclosed in the red.Apple stock jumped 6.78%, and the company recouped some of thesteep lossesit suffered after Trump declared tariffs in April.Trump's harsh trade policy has weighed on Apple for much of the year as the president threatened to disrupt its supply chain.

First giving a boost the crypto market overnight was news about President Trump's intention to sign an executive order allowing crypto(among other assets)in 401(k)retirement plans (that orderhas now been signed). The push above $117,000 occurred late in the U.S. trading session Thursday onnews of the nominationof Stephen Miran to replace the departing Andrea Kluger on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Currently the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Miran is presumably an ally of the president and for now probably likely to at least partially share his dovish views on the current level of interest rates. Even prior to the Miran selection, a series of Fed speakers over past days \u2014 reacting to Friday's weak jobs numbers and Monday's soft ISM Services print \u2014 made clear their expectation that a rate cut is likely coming at the central bank's next meeting in September. According to CME FedWatch the chance of September cut had risen to 95% from just 38% one week ago. The Fed's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is taking place in two weeks. The confab has in recent years served as a spot for Fed chairs to signal important policy actions, so all eyes and ears are likely to be focused on Jerome Powell's keynote speech there.

Institutional accumulation helped fuel a recovery rally after early-session lows, with price action coalescing between $2.48 and $2.52 before a sharp upside break around 10:00 UTC, supported by 3.36 million in trading volume. The asset\u2019s advance, partially influenced by global risk-off sentiment, reflected investors\u2019 pivot to alternative assets during heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Late-Session Sell-Off Caps Bullish Momentum Despite its earlier strength, NEAR\u2019s final hour of trading\u2014from 13:06 to 14:05 UTC\u2014witnessed a surge in volatility that erased most intraday gains. After briefly testing resistance at $2.61, a spike in volume between 13:39 and 13:42 coincided with profit-taking behavior. Selling pressure shaped a descending channel, with price retreating to close at $2.60, slightly above fresh support near $2.598. The move signals possible short-term exhaustion, as institutional distribution may be limiting further upside despite earlier accumulation. Macro Conditions Continue to Shape Market Dynamics The backdrop of NEAR\u2019s performance remains heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic forces. As major economies recalibrate monetary policy in response to inflationary effects from ongoing trade disputes, institutional flows into digital assets like NEAR have intensified. The cryptocurrency\u2019s intraday pullback mirrors broader market hesitation, as participants digest global policy shifts and their implications for crypto-market structure and risk appetite.

The upward trend formed on a series of higher lows, a sign of sustained buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.. Volume spikes accompanied each move higher, suggesting that larger investors may be accumulating. While the rally has technical strength, the broader context is more complicated. Trading volume across PEPE derivatives contracts has dropped 73% since mid-July according toCoinGlassdata. That drop in activity comes amid a rise in the PEPE token holdings of the 100 largest addresses on the Ethereum network. Over the past 30 days, these addresses added 2.36% to their holdings, while exchange reserves dropped by 2.4%, perNansen. The rise of PEPE\u2019s price is likely tied to an ongoing rally in risk assets, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps in September. The CME\u2019sFedWatchtool is currently weighing a 93% chance of that happening, whilePolymarket tradersplace chances at 79%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump calls on Intel chief to resign", "content": " Tim Bradshawin London andDemetri Sevastopuloin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world US President Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d The post did not detail Tan\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:01.132919", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "A"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Spain shuns US F-35 jets as tensions grow with Washington", "content": " Barney Jopsonin Madrid andLeila Abboudin Paris PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Spain is opting to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft rather than the US F-35, as tensions over defence and foreign policy strain Madrid\u2019s relations with Washington.Madrid\u2019s decision to shun Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35s is the latest sign of a rift with the US over defence, afterDonald Trumpbranded as \u201cterrible\u201d Spain\u2019s refusal to boost military expenditure to 5 per cent of GDP by 2035 earlier this year.\u201cThe Spanish option consists of the current Eurofighter and the FCAS in the future,\u201d the Spanish defence ministry told the Financial Times, referring to the Future Combat Air System, a joint programme between France, Germany and Spain.Trump\u2019s return to the White House and his wavering commitment to Nato have prompted several countries to question their reliance on US armaments, but Spain\u2019srefusalto meet the president\u2019s demand to boost military spending to 5 per cent has made Madrid an outlier among Nato members.Until Spain\u2019s announcement, Portugal was the only European country that had publicly signalled it was considering alternatives to the F-35, citing a need to consider the \u201cpredictability of our allies\u201d. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:04.494387", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "A"}

The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:05.986946", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "A"}

Miran, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announced plans to leave the central bank months before her term was set to end in January. The US president said in a Truth Social post on Thursday thatMiranwould serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The Senate must confirm Miran\u2019s nomination to the Fed board. The legislative body approved his appointment to the CEA by 53 votes to 46 in March. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised chair Jay Powell for the central bank\u2019s refusal to cut borrowing costs this year. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation before cutting rates from a current range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman both dissented with the Fed\u2019s July decision to hold rates steady. Trump is widely expected to ultimately use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Feds, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked an broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "AI agents aren\u2019t the \u2018new Google,\u2019 says Airbnb CEO", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After a second-quarter earningsbeat, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared his thoughts on the company\u2019s AI strategy, cautioning investors that AI chatbots can\u2019t yet be thought of as the \u201cnew Google.\u201d That is, AI chatbots, while potentially driving new leads to the travel and services business, aren\u2019t entirely a replacement for the referrals that the dominant search engine brings. At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs maydiminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S.relative their peers in the region.\u2013 Amala BalakrishnerIn the marketsIndian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.Both the benchmarkNifty 50and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:45:00.675916", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

The push above $117,000 occurred late in the U.S. trading session Thursday onnews of the nominationof Stephen Miran to replace the departing Andrea Kluger on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Currently the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Miran is presumably an ally of the president and for now probably likely to at least partially share his dovish views on the current level of interest rates. Even prior to the Miran selection, a series of Fed speakers over past days \u2014 reacting to Friday's weak jobs numbers and Monday's soft ISM Services print \u2014 made clear their expectation that a rate cut is likely coming at the central bank's next meeting in September. According to CME FedWatch the chance of September cut had risen to 95% from just 38% one week ago. The Fed's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is taking place in two weeks. The confab has in recent years served as a spot for Fed chairs to signal important policy actions, so all eyes and ears are likely to be focused on Jerome Powell's keynote speech there.

Institutional accumulation helped fuel a recovery rally after early-session lows, with price action coalescing between $2.48 and $2.52 before a sharp upside break around 10:00 UTC, supported by 3.36 million in trading volume. The asset\u2019s advance, partially influenced by global risk-off sentiment, reflected investors\u2019 pivot to alternative assets during heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Late-Session Sell-Off Caps Bullish Momentum Despite its earlier strength, NEAR\u2019s final hour of trading\u2014from 13:06 to 14:05 UTC\u2014witnessed a surge in volatility that erased most intraday gains. After briefly testing resistance at $2.61, a spike in volume between 13:39 and 13:42 coincided with profit-taking behavior. Selling pressure shaped a descending channel, with price retreating to close at $2.60, slightly above fresh support near $2.598. The move signals possible short-term exhaustion, as institutional distribution may be limiting further upside despite earlier accumulation. Macro Conditions Continue to Shape Market Dynamics The backdrop of NEAR\u2019s performance remains heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic forces. As major economies recalibrate monetary policy in response to inflationary effects from ongoing trade disputes, institutional flows into digital assets like NEAR have intensified. The cryptocurrency\u2019s intraday pullback mirrors broader market hesitation, as participants digest global policy shifts and their implications for crypto-market structure and risk appetite.

The upward trend formed on a series of higher lows, a sign of sustained buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.. Volume spikes accompanied each move higher, suggesting that larger investors may be accumulating. While the rally has technical strength, the broader context is more complicated. Trading volume across PEPE derivatives contracts has dropped 73% since mid-July according toCoinGlassdata. That drop in activity comes amid a rise in the PEPE token holdings of the 100 largest addresses on the Ethereum network. Over the past 30 days, these addresses added 2.36% to their holdings, while exchange reserves dropped by 2.4%, perNansen. The rise of PEPE\u2019s price is likely tied to an ongoing rally in risk assets, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps in September. The CME\u2019sFedWatchtool is currently weighing a 93% chance of that happening, whilePolymarket tradersplace chances at 79%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump calls on Intel chief to resign", "content": " Tim Bradshawin London andDemetri Sevastopuloin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world US President Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d The post did not detail Tan\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:01.132919", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Spain shuns US F-35 jets as tensions grow with Washington", "content": " Barney Jopsonin Madrid andLeila Abboudin Paris PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Spain is opting to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft rather than the US F-35, as tensions over defence and foreign policy strain Madrid\u2019s relations with Washington.Madrid\u2019s decision to shun Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35s is the latest sign of a rift with the US over defence, afterDonald Trumpbranded as \u201cterrible\u201d Spain\u2019s refusal to boost military expenditure to 5 per cent of GDP by 2035 earlier this year.\u201cThe Spanish option consists of the current Eurofighter and the FCAS in the future,\u201d the Spanish defence ministry told the Financial Times, referring to the Future Combat Air System, a joint programme between France, Germany and Spain.Trump\u2019s return to the White House and his wavering commitment to Nato have prompted several countries to question their reliance on US armaments, but Spain\u2019srefusalto meet the president\u2019s demand to boost military spending to 5 per cent has made Madrid an outlier among Nato members.Until Spain\u2019s announcement, Portugal was the only European country that had publicly signalled it was considering alternatives to the F-35, citing a need to consider the \u201cpredictability of our allies\u201d. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:04.494387", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump\u2019s new tariff regime deepens global trade war", "content": " Aime Williamsin Washington PublishedAugust 6 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs took effect at 12.01am in Washington on Thursday, pushing American import duties to their highest level in a century as the US president launched a new era of trade rivalry. The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:05.986946", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

Miran, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announced plans to leave the central bank months before her term was set to end in January. The US president said in a Truth Social post on Thursday thatMiranwould serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The Senate must confirm Miran\u2019s nomination to the Fed board. The legislative body approved his appointment to the CEA by 53 votes to 46 in March. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised chair Jay Powell for the central bank\u2019s refusal to cut borrowing costs this year. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation before cutting rates from a current range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman both dissented with the Fed\u2019s July decision to hold rates steady. Trump is widely expected to ultimately use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Feds, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked an broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:24.184414", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

Institutional accumulation helped fuel a recovery rally after early-session lows, with price action coalescing between $2.48 and $2.52 before a sharp upside break around 10:00 UTC, supported by 3.36 million in trading volume. The asset\u2019s advance, partially influenced by global risk-off sentiment, reflected investors\u2019 pivot to alternative assets during heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Late-Session Sell-Off Caps Bullish Momentum Despite its earlier strength, NEAR\u2019s final hour of trading\u2014from 13:06 to 14:05 UTC\u2014witnessed a surge in volatility that erased most intraday gains. After briefly testing resistance at $2.61, a spike in volume between 13:39 and 13:42 coincided with profit-taking behavior. Selling pressure shaped a descending channel, with price retreating to close at $2.60, slightly above fresh support near $2.598. The move signals possible short-term exhaustion, as institutional distribution may be limiting further upside despite earlier accumulation. Macro Conditions Continue to Shape Market Dynamics The backdrop of NEAR\u2019s performance remains heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic forces. As major economies recalibrate monetary policy in response to inflationary effects from ongoing trade disputes, institutional flows into digital assets like NEAR have intensified. The cryptocurrency\u2019s intraday pullback mirrors broader market hesitation, as participants digest global policy shifts and their implications for crypto-market structure and risk appetite.

The upward trend formed on a series of higher lows, a sign of sustained buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.. Volume spikes accompanied each move higher, suggesting that larger investors may be accumulating. While the rally has technical strength, the broader context is more complicated. Trading volume across PEPE derivatives contracts has dropped 73% since mid-July according toCoinGlassdata. That drop in activity comes amid a rise in the PEPE token holdings of the 100 largest addresses on the Ethereum network. Over the past 30 days, these addresses added 2.36% to their holdings, while exchange reserves dropped by 2.4%, perNansen. The rise of PEPE\u2019s price is likely tied to an ongoing rally in risk assets, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps in September.

But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:48.960032", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump to nominate Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board", "content": " Claire Jonesin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 8 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has said he will nominate Stephen Miran to temporarily join the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors \u2014 a move that would bring a critic of chair Jay Powell on to the central bank\u2019s policy-setting panel. Miran, chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and a crucial Trump ally, is one of the architects of the president\u2019stariff policy. Miran has argued that the US\u2019s sweeping levies would not be inflationary, a view that clashes with that of Powell and several other top Fed officials. Miran will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announcedplans to leave the central bankmonths before her term was set to end in January. He will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday that Miran would serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised Powell for the central bank\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold this year, with the president calling for a reduction of as much as 3 percentage points. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs oninflationbefore cutting rates from the current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was previously a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman dissented with the Fed\u2019s decision in July to hold rates steady, calling for immediate cuts in borrowing costs. Miran said in a television interview on Thursday that many Fed officials were suffering from \u201ctariff derangement syndrome\u201d because of their views that tariffs would increase inflation. He has argued that Trump\u2019s overall fiscal policies were \u201cextremely disinflationary\u201d, easing the need for high rates. He has also criticised Powell for advocating for fiscal stimulus measures to fight the economic ructions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Miran has said the Fed chief has moved too slowly on adjusting monetary policy. JPMorgan said after Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it now expects a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September. Some economists had already begun to pencil in a reduction in borrowing costs next month following data last week that pointed to asharp slowdown in hiringthis summer. \u201cGiven his support of Trump\u2019s policies, we think Miran would likely continue to act as a Trump loyalist once on the Fed board, calling for lower rates and voting for rate cuts in FOMC meetings,\u201d said Marco Casiraghi, an economist at Evercore ISI. Trump is widely expected to use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Fed banks, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. He also wanted to make it easier to fire Fed officials and halt a \u201crevolving door\u201d between the central bank and the White House. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked and broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:53.536187", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}

The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:55.008915", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "AI agents aren\u2019t the \u2018new Google,\u2019 says Airbnb CEO", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After a second-quarter earningsbeat, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared his thoughts on the company\u2019s AI strategy, cautioning investors that AI chatbots can\u2019t yet be thought of as the \u201cnew Google.\u201d That is, AI chatbots, while potentially driving new leads to the travel and services business, aren\u2019t entirely a replacement for the referrals that the dominant search engine brings. At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs maydiminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S.relative their peers in the region.\u2013 Amala BalakrishnerIn the marketsIndian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.Both the benchmarkNifty 50and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:45:00.675916", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "PEPE Jumps 5% as Rate-Cut Bets and Whale Accumulation Drive Risk Asset Rally", "content": "Popular memecoin PEPE has risen more than 5% over the last 24 hours, powered by a high-volume breakout that helped the token\u2019s price surge above a recent resistance level. The upward trend formed on a series of higher lows, a sign of sustained buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.. Volume spikes accompanied each move higher, suggesting that larger investors may be accumulating. While the rally has technical strength, the broader context is more complicated. Trading volume across PEPE derivatives contracts has dropped 73% since mid-July according toCoinGlassdata. That drop in activity comes amid a rise in the PEPE token holdings of the 100 largest addresses on the Ethereum network. Over the past 30 days, these addresses added 2.36% to their holdings, while exchange reserves dropped by 2.4%, perNansen. The rise of PEPE\u2019s price is likely tied to an ongoing rally in risk assets, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps in September. The CME\u2019sFedWatchtool is currently weighing a 93% chance of that happening, whilePolymarket tradersplace chances at 79%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump calls on Intel chief to resign", "content": " Tim Bradshawin London andDemetri Sevastopuloin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world US President Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d The post did not detail Tan\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:01.132919", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Spain shuns US F-35 jets as tensions grow with Washington", "content": " Barney Jopsonin Madrid andLeila Abboudin Paris PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Spain is opting to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft rather than the US F-35, as tensions over defence and foreign policy strain Madrid\u2019s relations with Washington.Madrid\u2019s decision to shun Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35s is the latest sign of a rift with the US over defence, afterDonald Trumpbranded as \u201cterrible\u201d Spain\u2019s refusal to boost military expenditure to 5 per cent of GDP by 2035 earlier this year.\u201cThe Spanish option consists of the current Eurofighter and the FCAS in the future,\u201d the Spanish defence ministry told the Financial Times, referring to the Future Combat Air System, a joint programme between France, Germany and Spain.Trump\u2019s return to the White House and his wavering commitment to Nato have prompted several countries to question their reliance on US armaments, but Spain\u2019srefusalto meet the president\u2019s demand to boost military spending to 5 per cent has made Madrid an outlier among Nato members.Until Spain\u2019s announcement, Portugal was the only European country that had publicly signalled it was considering alternatives to the F-35, citing a need to consider the \u201cpredictability of our allies\u201d. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:04.494387", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump\u2019s new tariff regime deepens global trade war", "content": " Aime Williamsin Washington PublishedAugust 6 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs took effect at 12.01am in Washington on Thursday, pushing American import duties to their highest level in a century as the US president launched a new era of trade rivalry. The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:05.986946", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

Miran, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announced plans to leave the central bank months before her term was set to end in January. The US president said in a Truth Social post on Thursday thatMiranwould serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The Senate must confirm Miran\u2019s nomination to the Fed board. The legislative body approved his appointment to the CEA by 53 votes to 46 in March. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised chair Jay Powell for the central bank\u2019s refusal to cut borrowing costs this year. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation before cutting rates from a current range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman both dissented with the Fed\u2019s July decision to hold rates steady. Trump is widely expected to ultimately use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Feds, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked an broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.

Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:24.184414", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump calls on Intel chief to resign", "content": " Tim Bradshawin London andDemetri Sevastopuloin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world US President Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d The post did not detail Tan\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:48.960032", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump to nominate Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board", "content": " Claire Jonesin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 8 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has said he will nominate Stephen Miran to temporarily join the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors \u2014 a move that would bring a critic of chair Jay Powell on to the central bank\u2019s policy-setting panel. Miran, chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and a crucial Trump ally, is one of the architects of the president\u2019stariff policy. Miran has argued that the US\u2019s sweeping levies would not be inflationary, a view that clashes with that of Powell and several other top Fed officials. Miran will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announcedplans to leave the central bankmonths before her term was set to end in January. He will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday that Miran would serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised Powell for the central bank\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold this year, with the president calling for a reduction of as much as 3 percentage points. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs oninflationbefore cutting rates from the current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was previously a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman dissented with the Fed\u2019s decision in July to hold rates steady, calling for immediate cuts in borrowing costs. Miran said in a television interview on Thursday that many Fed officials were suffering from \u201ctariff derangement syndrome\u201d because of their views that tariffs would increase inflation. He has argued that Trump\u2019s overall fiscal policies were \u201cextremely disinflationary\u201d, easing the need for high rates. He has also criticised Powell for advocating for fiscal stimulus measures to fight the economic ructions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Miran has said the Fed chief has moved too slowly on adjusting monetary policy. JPMorgan said after Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it now expects a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September. Some economists had already begun to pencil in a reduction in borrowing costs next month following data last week that pointed to asharp slowdown in hiringthis summer. \u201cGiven his support of Trump\u2019s policies, we think Miran would likely continue to act as a Trump loyalist once on the Fed board, calling for lower rates and voting for rate cuts in FOMC meetings,\u201d said Marco Casiraghi, an economist at Evercore ISI. Trump is widely expected to use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Fed banks, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. He also wanted to make it easier to fire Fed officials and halt a \u201crevolving door\u201d between the central bank and the White House. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked and broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:53.536187", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump\u2019s new tariff regime deepens global trade war", "content": " Aime Williamsin Washington PublishedAugust 6 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs took effect at 12.01am in Washington on Thursday, pushing American import duties to their highest level in a century as the US president launched a new era of trade rivalry. The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:55.008915", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "AI agents aren\u2019t the \u2018new Google,\u2019 says Airbnb CEO", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After a second-quarter earningsbeat, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared his thoughts on the company\u2019s AI strategy, cautioning investors that AI chatbots can\u2019t yet be thought of as the \u201cnew Google.\u201d That is, AI chatbots, while potentially driving new leads to the travel and services business, aren\u2019t entirely a replacement for the referrals that the dominant search engine brings. At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "How Tim Cook convinced Trump to drop made-in-USA iPhone \u2014 for now", "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with President Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S.But a closer look at Apple's announcements suggest that what Cook disclosed was an update to its U.S. strategy, not a major break.Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trumphas made clear that he wantsAppleto make iPhones in the U.S.Apple CEOTim Cookis doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.Cook on Wednesdayappearedat the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce themade-in-USA iPhonethat Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.Trump appeared happy enough, for now.\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that woulddouble their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\" The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.For example, Applesaidthat all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made byCorning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up witha $250 millioncommitment in 2019, and $45million in 2021.Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership withTexas Instrumentsto make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are withApplied Materials, a tooling company,GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplyingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.GlobalFoundries manufactures chips forBroadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plantin 2022and committed to buying chips from the factory.Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an ArizonaAmkorfacility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"Trump had a different take.\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments. Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers arecontractually requiredto keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Applesaidin February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate ofabout $70 billion per year. In February, the companycommittedto $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previouslypredicteda made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\" Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRONvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of earningsA bearish 'double top' pattern just formed in the Dow.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "China's July factory-gate prices miss forecast, deflation concerns persist", "content": "China's producer prices fell more than expected in July, while consumer prices were unchanged, underscoring the impact of sluggish domestic demand and persistent trade uncertainty on consumer and business sentiment.Factory-gate prices have been declining for more than two years, and Saturday's data suggest early-stage efforts to tackle price competition have yet to yield significant results.Deflationary pressures have prompted Chinese authorities to address overcapacity in key industries. However, the latest round of\u00a0industrial restructuring\u00a0appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.The producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.Extreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.However, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.Despite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.He expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.Still, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.China's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.Extreme weather added to the economic strain, with swelteringheatgripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usualdownpourslashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"The property sector has not stabilized. The economy is still supported more by external demand than domestic consumption.

Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \"swapping\" territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\"More from NBC News:Trump says ceasefire talks with Putin set for next week in AlaskaWith Zelenskyy sidelined, Trump appears to hand Putin a winRussia claims capture of key Ukrainian stronghold and hits KyivA White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \"decisions against peace,\" adding, \"They will not achieve anything.\"The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday.Russia's demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in each region.It remains unclear whether Trump's reference to \"swapping\" territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side's control.Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \"security guarantees\" from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe sinceWorld War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.In Trump's first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \"got along great\" with him.But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war.Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday.\"The underlying issues have not changed,\" he said. \"For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\" He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \"another step\" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.On the ground, the Kremlin's larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region's prosecutor's office said Saturday.Ukraine's Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/trump-zelenskyy-rejects-ukraine-russia-territory-swap-proposal.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:46:38.134752", "sentiment_score": -0.13220000267028809, "symbol": "COST"}

A lot of Ukrainians have died,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d But on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the possibility of ceding parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Russian forces did not control. \u201cUkrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address\u00a0on Telegram. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the Constitution in Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Zelenskyy also warned that any meeting between Trump and Putin that sidestepped Kyiv risked undermining Kyiv\u2019s long-standing diplomatic principle of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d. \u201cAny decisions that are against us, any decisions that are against Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cIn the coming days, Moscow and Washington will devote themselves to the intensive development of the practical and political parameters of the summit in Alaska.\u201d This will be a \u201cchallenging process\u201d, he added. Western and Ukrainian officials suggested the discussion of territorial concessions echoed plans Putin presented in a meeting in Moscow last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump says talks are under way for \u2018swapping of territories\u2019 in the Ukraine-Russia war Trump briefed European leaders on Witkoff\u2019s meeting in a call on Wednesday, which was joined by Zelenskyy. Senior Ukrainian officials involved in calls with the US and European allies said Putin had floated the plan for Ukraine to cede large swaths of its territory during the three-hour meeting with Witkoff. Another western official said there had been extensive discussions of land swaps. Putin\u2019s proposals had veered little from the maximalist claims to Ukraine he had laid out in 2022, the Ukrainian officials said. Russia\u2019s leader proposed freezing the front line in south-eastern Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including territory not currently controlled by Moscow\u2019s forces, the officials said. Russia controls almost all of Luhansk region and a huge swatch of Donetsk region, but has struggled to capture critical Ukrainian strongholds in the latter despite its summer offensive. The southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where Russian forces have been stuck on the south-eastern side of the Dnipro river would be up for discussion, as would small areas of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions controlled by the Russian military. Moscow could withdraw forces from those regions. A recent Gallup poll suggested that Ukrainians\u2019 support for fighting until victory has hit a new low, with 69 per cent favouring a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible \u2014 a nearly complete reversal from public opinion in 2022. But polls also suggest most Ukrainians are not prepared to formally concede territory in exchange for peace. Putin also demanded Nato membership for Ukraine be taken off the table, although EU membership would still be allowed, the officials said. Ukraine\u2019s military would be limited in size, and Russia would demand western allies not provide Kyiv with long-range weapons. Renouncing Nato membership would be resisted by Ukraine and its European allies, officials said. \u201cIt looks like Munich 1938, when great powers decide the fate of the victim of the aggression,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Ukrainian parliament and an MP in Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party. He called what Putin was offering to end the war \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and said agreement by Zelenskyy \u201cmight cause a social explosion in Ukraine\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments that land could be exchanged came ahead of a planned meeting in the UK involving British foreign secretary David Lammy and US vice-president JD Vance to discuss Ukraine. One person familiar with the matter said Witkoff could attend the meeting at Lammy\u2019s official residence in southern England. Another said Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, could also attend. Trump kicked off a new round of diplomacy last month when he expressed anger with Russia\u2019s continued attacks on Ukraine and gave Putin a 10-day deadline to agree a ceasefire or face US economic penalties. Recommended The Financial Times previously reported that Trump could hit Moscow\u2019s shadow fleet of oil tankers withsanctionsto staunch a stream of petrodollars to Putin\u2019s war chest. The US has also threatened to target importers of Russian oil. Friday marked the passing of Trump\u2019s deadline \u2014 although he said he believed Putin and Zelenskyy were still eager to secure an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

People close to the Ukrainian president told the Financial Times that he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s decision to hold a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week without inviting Ukraine to participate. The prospect of Trump and Putin discussing the war behind closed doors, without Ukrainian representation, has raised deep concerns in Kyiv that the future of Ukraine could be negotiated over its head. On Saturday Zelenskyy was attempting to build a unified position with European leaders to firm up international opposition to any backroom deal that could compromise Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, according to senior officials close to the president. His efforts come as officials from the US, Europe and Ukraine prepare to meet in the UK on Saturday. Zelenskyy has dispatched Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine\u2019s secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, to the talks, which US Vice-President JD Vance will attend. Umerov has led Kyiv\u2019s delegation in each of the three rounds of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul since March. Zelenskyy and his advisers are trying to persuade Trump and his team to adopt what one official called a more \u201crational\u201d approach to Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. There is particular anxiety that Trump could seek a quick resolution to the war by offering Putin territorial concessions, legitimising its illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of huge parts of four mainland regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. On Saturday Ukrainian officials were adamant that the US president did not have the legal or political power to order Ukraine to hand over land. Even if Trump wanted to cut a deal, \u201cnobody here in Ukraine has a legal way to give up territories\u201d, an the official added. In an address the nation on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that a peace deal with Russia could involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d, insisting that Ukrainians \u201cwill not gift their land to the occupier\u201d. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the constitution in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Trump announced on Friday that he would meetPutinin Alaska on August 15, adding that a peace deal would probably involve Kyiv ceding territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both,\u201d Trump said. That idea was dismissed in Kyiv. \u201cUkraine will not accept any agreement made without it, especially one that legitimises Russia\u2019s occupation of its sovereign territory,\u201d said another Ukrainian official. Any such deal would have to be ratified by parliament, officials in Kyiv said. Numerous\u00a0Ukrainian MPs including many from Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party have told the Financial Times that they would not vote on legislation that would see parts of Ukraine handed over to Russia as part of a deal to end the war. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s summit, which will be hosted by UK foreign secretary David Lammy at his country residence outside London, Zelenskyy held calls with several European leaders. Downing Street said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy \u201cagreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war\u201d. Zelenskyy said of his call with Starmer that \u201cwe share the same view on the need for a truly lasting peace for Ukraine and on the danger of Russia\u2019s plan to reduce everything to discussing the impossible\u201d. Following a call with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe see no changes in Russia\u2019s position \u2014 the Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war and still push the idea of \u2018exchanging\u2019 Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favourable positions for Russia to resume the war.\u201d At the summit, European capitals will seek to clarify \u201chow determined\u201d the US administration is in sealing a deal with Putin and whether it is conscious of the implications of any territorial concessions to Russia, one European government official told the FT. Conflicting\u00a0scenarios have been set out by different parts of the Trump administration, with differences between what secretary of state Marco Rubio, US special Envoy Steve Witkoff and even Trump himself had conveyed, the person said. Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that the Russian proposal included a freezing of the frontline in south-eastern Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to pull back from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that it still controlled. Moscow has previously laid claim to the entire Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions despite the two regional capitals remaining under Ukrainian control. Swaths of land controlled by Russian forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions may be up for discussion, the officials said. Leaders in the Baltic states criticised any push to force Ukraine into ceding territory amid worries that the region could be a target for Putin. \u201cIf borders can be changed by force, none are safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the cornerstones of global stability. We will not reward aggression \u2014 not in Ukraine, not anywhere,\u201d Margus Tsahkna, Estonia\u2019s foreign minister, said.

Such peace must involve Ukraine and uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Ukraine has spent the past few years fortifying big cities in the Donetsk region that Moscow is reportedly demanding Kyiv give up. More than 120,000 people still live in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the two main cities in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk. \u201cIf Ukraine cedes territory without concessions or enforceable guarantees, Russia would then seize fortified defensive lines at no cost,\u201d a former Ukrainian officer who runs analytical group Frontelligence Insight wrote on X. \u201cFrom that position Moscow will renew hostilities with impunity.\u201d Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo, Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Berlin, Anna Gross in London and James Politi in Washington", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/69ab6ad3-826e-4bda-a512-250992d09cae", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:12.434396", "sentiment_score": -0.5577999949455261, "symbol": "TGT"}

On Thursday, the Customs and Border Protection agency had published a ruling, which was first reported by the Financial Times, saying one-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars should beclassified with a customs codethat is subject to tariffs. Its decision stood in sharp contrast to a previous White House statement in April that bullion would be exempt from Trump\u2019s levies. Gold for December delivery dropped by 1 per cent to $3,460 per troy ounce on Friday after the FT reported on the White House\u2019s plan to clarify its tariff.

The London Bullion Market Association, which represents large institutional gold traders and banks, said on Friday evening that it was \u201cseeking clarification\u201d from US authorities. The US Comex is the world\u2019s largest financial market for bullion, but to function efficiently the market relies on having unfettered access to the physicalgoldmarket centred on London \u2014 which would be threatened by any levies, according to market participants. Many in the gold industry have questioned whether the CBP ruling, which was written in response to an inquiry from a Swiss refiner, could have been a bureaucratic mistake. \u201cThe US has to decide if the White House was wrong in April, or if the CBP is wrong now,\u201d said one executive. Switzerland was dealt a particularly heavy blow as a result of the US\u2019s tariffs decision, since the country is the world\u2019s largest refining hub. The tariff ruling would \u201cnegatively impact\u201d the flow of physical gold around the world, noted the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders in Precious Metals Association in astatementon Friday. Trump reignited his global trade war earlier this week by reimposing his reciprocaltariffson almost every US trading partner, pushing American import duties to their highest level in decades. But the US president has also offered a host of exemptions to the levies, including to products such as pharmaceuticals or chips, that the US may apply separate tariffs to in future. In April, the US issued further exemptions to a range of consumer electronics such as laptops, smartphones and earphones. Trump has also signalled he may be willing to offer carve-outs for companies such as Apple that promise to make big investments in the US. But the high volume of executive orders on trade issued by the White House in a short space of time has left many businesses seeking clarification over which products are hit and which are not.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c2868087-9951-4f04-818f-5082437f603a", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:13.842438", "sentiment_score": -0.95660001039505, "symbol": "AAPL"}

The abrupt removal of the chief of the US government\u2019s tax collection and enforcement agency on Friday caps a period of extraordinary turmoil and turnover at theIRS. Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January there have been four acting commissioners at the IRS prior to the start of Long\u2019s tenure in June. Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, will now become acting commissioner of the IRS. The Treasury department oversees the tax agency so Long was already reporting to Bessent prior to his removal. Long said in a post on X on Friday that he had been tapped to be US ambassador to Iceland: \u201cIt is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\u201d The New York Times first reportedTrumpwas planning to remove Long, who was a former auctioneer, property agent and member of Congress before he took up the post at the IRS. The White House and Treasury did not explain why the president wanted him out of the tax service. A Treasury spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cHis zeal and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to the Federal Government was evident in both the House of Representatives and as part of the Trump Administration. A new candidate for Commissioner will be announced at the appropriate time.\u201d The IRS has shed about a quarter of its workforce since Trump\u2019s second term began as the White House moved rapidly to slash the size of government agencies. The dismissals of IRS staff this year stands in contrast to a boost in funding that former president Joe Biden enacted during his time in office in order to increase the agency\u2019s capacity to audit wealthy taxpayers. Long had recently placed two top IRS officials on administrative leave, said one person familiar with the matter. The New York Times on Thursday reported that Long sent an email to staff telling them they could leave work early on Friday. \u201cPlease enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow. That way you\u2019ll be rested for my 70th birthday on Monday!\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3dd915d4-14d0-4bbf-8e37-66e6eff1c5cc", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:15.424721", "sentiment_score": -0.7045000195503235, "symbol": "HAS"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Reeves hopes promise of fairness will cushion potential Budget tax rises", "content": " Anna GrossandDavid Sheppard PublishedAugust 8 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Rachel Reeves plans to link tax rises in the Budget with a promise of improved living conditions in the longer term, as the chancellor and her team begin drawing up a list of which measures she may tighten in the autumn. The chancellor is keen to try and soften the blow of any revenue raising measures on households, according to people close to her, but economists predict she may need to make drastic changes to fill a hole of around \u00a340bn in the public finances. \u201cThe budget is a moment, but she wants to make sure there\u2019s a bigger economic agenda pushing through,\u201d said one person close to the chancellor. The narrative around improving equity and fairness for working people is seen as key to fending off the threat posed by Nigel Farage, who has attracted former Labour voters with a simple message about economic and national decline, which he has tied to high levels of migration. People close to Reeves said she plans to drip feed announcements in the autumn, including finalising the Northern Powerhouse rail project and introducing fresh legislation to speed up planning for infrastructure projects such as data centres, that speak to the government\u2019s wider goal of improving productivity. Reeves sat down with Sir Keir Starmer this past week to go through which taxes to increase, a task made harder by the pledge not to increase income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. Treasury officials insist the three will not be touched in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge. Reeves is also working through a pile of proposals from Treasury officials for tax increases that economists believe could include measures such as freezing tax bands, raising duties on unhealthy foods and gambling, and even potentially increasing fuel duty. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said if the black hole was only \u00a320-\u00a325bn, this would allow the Treasury to \u201cmake some pretty sensible changes\u201d that would not inflict too much damage on the economy and could fit into a marketable centre-left story. Those measures could include prolonging a freeze on income tax band thresholds \u2014 a measure derided last year as \u201cunfair\u201d by Reeves \u2014 to increase receipts by around \u00a34bn a year, and moves such as increasing duties on unhealthy foods to tackle the obesity crisis. But Smith said if the black hole exceeded \u00a340bn, as many economists fear, the government would need to look at more drastic measures. \u201cThe big political call is whether to break one of the manifesto pledges,\u201d Smith said. Last year, ahead of the election, senior Labour figures were set on ruling out increases to National Insurance and income tax, but wavered for 24 hours before ruling out increases to VAT, according to officials. The UK deploys sales taxes more narrowly than many comparable countries. Broadening the scope of the tax rather than raising it may allow Reeves to claim the pledge is intact. Taxes on the gambling industry look almost certain to increase at the budget, a proposal championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown this week, who wants the \u00a33bn increase on duties paid by online betting groups to fund removing the contentious two-child benefit cap. But many other taxes are in play. Downing Street is keeping an open mind given uncertainty about the scale of the challenge the UK faces in balancing the national books. Starmer has laid down no red lines outside the manifesto pledge, leaving taxes such as fuel duty \u2014 normally seen as politically toxic \u2014 as an option, economists say. Increasing fuel duty would align with the wider Labour narrative about investing in net zero and electrification, though the level has been frozen for more than a decade. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour was \u201cgearing up to punish the British public with more tax rises\u201d. People close to the PM insist the plan for the autumn is not a \u201creset\u201d despite Labour enduring a difficult first year in office, which has left it trailing Reform UK in the polls. Starmer remains focused on boosting the economy, they say, and is desperate to accelerate progress in areas like planning reform. Mujtaba Rahman at Eurasia Group questioned, however, whether voters would really think that a message of \u201cfairness\u201d would sweeten the sour note of higher taxes enough. \u201cAt times this feels like a government in search of a narrative.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/297b01f4-e629-4811-8726-aed9dceea334", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:16.860632", "sentiment_score": 0.20839999616146088, "symbol": "ARE"}

Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,\u201d Altman promised. Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote. And Altman also promised, \u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.\u201d\u00a0This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.

The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar.

Others noted the charts in thepublished blog post were correct. But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model\u2019s performance,also pointed outthat turning data into a table was \u201cgood example of a GPT-5 failure.\u201d In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most.

Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous postson social mediaurging users to turn off location sharing,incorrectly claimingthat it\u2019s automatically turned on. \u201cWe\u2019re double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\u201d Mosseri said in aThreads post. \u201cWe\u2019re still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\u201d Mosseri also said that somepeople are \u201cconfused\u201dabout how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. It\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you\u2019re still at the location). If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn\u2019t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps below. To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new \u201cMap\u201d option at the top. If it\u2019s your first time accessing the feature, you\u2019ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads \u201cWho can see your location.\u201d From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the \u201cStory, live and location\u201d option, and then tap the \u201cLocation sharing\u201d button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you\u2019ll be able to see them on the Map. When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you\u2019ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or \u201cNotes,\u201d on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they\u2019re shared with a location.

Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, likea shark wearing sneakersanda ballerina with a cappuccino for a head. One startup driving this trend isOpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users. The company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising. With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden. Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion. The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy. While these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation. During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June,Disney and Universalsued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder. \u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters. One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent. \u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said. Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app. OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member. OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey \u2014 around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases. Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users\u2019 interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. \u201cI think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything\u00a0\u2026\u201d Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,\u201d he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn\u2019t talk about it that way, usually, because it\u2019s not how users think of it. \u201cBut when users say things like \u2018Pinterest just gets me,\u2019 it\u2019s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they\u2019re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,\u201d he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a \u201cCambrian moment,\u201d and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch anew set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention ofmass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn\u2019t say if that\u2019s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including onFacebook,Instagram, andTumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that\u2019s used for good and used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d \u201cOn the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cBoth in terms of what we\u2019re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what\u2019s happening in the rest of social media,\u201d he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle. The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customerswent bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May,Bloomberg reportedthat SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs maydiminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S.relative their peers in the region.\u2013 Amala BalakrishnerIn the marketsIndian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.Both the benchmarkNifty 50and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:45:00.675916", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

{"source": "CoinDesk", "title": "NEAR Protocol Posts 5% Recovery Amid Volatility Surge", "content": "NEAR Protocol climbed 5% from $2.47 to $2.60 in the 24-hour period ending 7 August at 14:00 UTC, exhibiting strong resilience amid broader market turbulence. Institutional accumulation helped fuel a recovery rally after early-session lows, with price action coalescing between $2.48 and $2.52 before a sharp upside break around 10:00 UTC, supported by 3.36 million in trading volume. The asset\u2019s advance, partially influenced by global risk-off sentiment, reflected investors\u2019 pivot to alternative assets during heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Late-Session Sell-Off Caps Bullish Momentum Despite its earlier strength, NEAR\u2019s final hour of trading\u2014from 13:06 to 14:05 UTC\u2014witnessed a surge in volatility that erased most intraday gains. After briefly testing resistance at $2.61, a spike in volume between 13:39 and 13:42 coincided with profit-taking behavior. Selling pressure shaped a descending channel, with price retreating to close at $2.60, slightly above fresh support near $2.598. The move signals possible short-term exhaustion, as institutional distribution may be limiting further upside despite earlier accumulation. Macro Conditions Continue to Shape Market Dynamics The backdrop of NEAR\u2019s performance remains heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic forces. As major economies recalibrate monetary policy in response to inflationary effects from ongoing trade disputes, institutional flows into digital assets like NEAR have intensified. The cryptocurrency\u2019s intraday pullback mirrors broader market hesitation, as participants digest global policy shifts and their implications for crypto-market structure and risk appetite.

The upward trend formed on a series of higher lows, a sign of sustained buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.. Volume spikes accompanied each move higher, suggesting that larger investors may be accumulating. While the rally has technical strength, the broader context is more complicated. Trading volume across PEPE derivatives contracts has dropped 73% since mid-July according toCoinGlassdata. That drop in activity comes amid a rise in the PEPE token holdings of the 100 largest addresses on the Ethereum network. Over the past 30 days, these addresses added 2.36% to their holdings, while exchange reserves dropped by 2.4%, perNansen. The rise of PEPE\u2019s price is likely tied to an ongoing rally in risk assets, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps in September. The CME\u2019sFedWatchtool is currently weighing a 93% chance of that happening, whilePolymarket tradersplace chances at 79%.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump calls on Intel chief to resign", "content": " Tim Bradshawin London andDemetri Sevastopuloin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world US President Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d The post did not detail Tan\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:01.132919", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Spain shuns US F-35 jets as tensions grow with Washington", "content": " Barney Jopsonin Madrid andLeila Abboudin Paris PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Spain is opting to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft rather than the US F-35, as tensions over defence and foreign policy strain Madrid\u2019s relations with Washington.Madrid\u2019s decision to shun Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35s is the latest sign of a rift with the US over defence, afterDonald Trumpbranded as \u201cterrible\u201d Spain\u2019s refusal to boost military expenditure to 5 per cent of GDP by 2035 earlier this year.\u201cThe Spanish option consists of the current Eurofighter and the FCAS in the future,\u201d the Spanish defence ministry told the Financial Times, referring to the Future Combat Air System, a joint programme between France, Germany and Spain.Trump\u2019s return to the White House and his wavering commitment to Nato have prompted several countries to question their reliance on US armaments, but Spain\u2019srefusalto meet the president\u2019s demand to boost military spending to 5 per cent has made Madrid an outlier among Nato members.Until Spain\u2019s announcement, Portugal was the only European country that had publicly signalled it was considering alternatives to the F-35, citing a need to consider the \u201cpredictability of our allies\u201d. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:04.494387", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump\u2019s new tariff regime deepens global trade war", "content": " Aime Williamsin Washington PublishedAugust 6 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs took effect at 12.01am in Washington on Thursday, pushing American import duties to their highest level in a century as the US president launched a new era of trade rivalry. The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:05.986946", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Donald Trump to nominate Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board", "content": " Claire Jonesin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has said he will nominate White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a soon-to-be vacant seat on the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors. Miran, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announced plans to leave the central bank months before her term was set to end in January. The US president said in a Truth Social post on Thursday thatMiranwould serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The Senate must confirm Miran\u2019s nomination to the Fed board. The legislative body approved his appointment to the CEA by 53 votes to 46 in March. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised chair Jay Powell for the central bank\u2019s refusal to cut borrowing costs this year. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation before cutting rates from a current range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman both dissented with the Fed\u2019s July decision to hold rates steady. Trump is widely expected to ultimately use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Feds, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked an broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d.

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope.

At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs maydiminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S.relative their peers in the region.\u2013 Amala BalakrishnerIn the marketsIndian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.Both the benchmarkNifty 50and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:24.184414", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

Currently the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Miran is presumably an ally of the president and for now probably likely to at least partially share his dovish views on the current level of interest rates. Even prior to the Miran selection, a series of Fed speakers over past days \u2014 reacting to Friday's weak jobs numbers and Monday's soft ISM Services print \u2014 made clear their expectation that a rate cut is likely coming at the central bank's next meeting in September.

Volume spikes accompanied each move higher, suggesting that larger investors may be accumulating. While the rally has technical strength, the broader context is more complicated. Trading volume across PEPE derivatives contracts has dropped 73% since mid-July according toCoinGlassdata. That drop in activity comes amid a rise in the PEPE token holdings of the 100 largest addresses on the Ethereum network. Over the past 30 days, these addresses added 2.36% to their holdings, while exchange reserves dropped by 2.4%, perNansen. The rise of PEPE\u2019s price is likely tied to an ongoing rally in risk assets, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps in September. The CME\u2019sFedWatchtool is currently weighing a 93% chance of that happening, whilePolymarket tradersplace chances at 79%.

But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:48.960032", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump to nominate Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board", "content": " Claire Jonesin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 8 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has said he will nominate Stephen Miran to temporarily join the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors \u2014 a move that would bring a critic of chair Jay Powell on to the central bank\u2019s policy-setting panel. Miran, chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and a crucial Trump ally, is one of the architects of the president\u2019stariff policy. Miran has argued that the US\u2019s sweeping levies would not be inflationary, a view that clashes with that of Powell and several other top Fed officials. Miran will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announcedplans to leave the central bankmonths before her term was set to end in January. He will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday that Miran would serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised Powell for the central bank\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold this year, with the president calling for a reduction of as much as 3 percentage points. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs oninflationbefore cutting rates from the current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was previously a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman dissented with the Fed\u2019s decision in July to hold rates steady, calling for immediate cuts in borrowing costs. Miran said in a television interview on Thursday that many Fed officials were suffering from \u201ctariff derangement syndrome\u201d because of their views that tariffs would increase inflation. He has argued that Trump\u2019s overall fiscal policies were \u201cextremely disinflationary\u201d, easing the need for high rates. He has also criticised Powell for advocating for fiscal stimulus measures to fight the economic ructions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Miran has said the Fed chief has moved too slowly on adjusting monetary policy. JPMorgan said after Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it now expects a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September. Some economists had already begun to pencil in a reduction in borrowing costs next month following data last week that pointed to asharp slowdown in hiringthis summer. \u201cGiven his support of Trump\u2019s policies, we think Miran would likely continue to act as a Trump loyalist once on the Fed board, calling for lower rates and voting for rate cuts in FOMC meetings,\u201d said Marco Casiraghi, an economist at Evercore ISI. Trump is widely expected to use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Fed banks, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. He also wanted to make it easier to fire Fed officials and halt a \u201crevolving door\u201d between the central bank and the White House. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked and broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:53.536187", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump\u2019s new tariff regime deepens global trade war", "content": " Aime Williamsin Washington PublishedAugust 6 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs took effect at 12.01am in Washington on Thursday, pushing American import duties to their highest level in a century as the US president launched a new era of trade rivalry. The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:55.008915", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy.

Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "AI agents aren\u2019t the \u2018new Google,\u2019 says Airbnb CEO", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After a second-quarter earningsbeat, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared his thoughts on the company\u2019s AI strategy, cautioning investors that AI chatbots can\u2019t yet be thought of as the \u201cnew Google.\u201d That is, AI chatbots, while potentially driving new leads to the travel and services business, aren\u2019t entirely a replacement for the referrals that the dominant search engine brings. At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "How Tim Cook convinced Trump to drop made-in-USA iPhone \u2014 for now", "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with President Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S.But a closer look at Apple's announcements suggest that what Cook disclosed was an update to its U.S. strategy, not a major break.Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trumphas made clear that he wantsAppleto make iPhones in the U.S.Apple CEOTim Cookis doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.Cook on Wednesdayappearedat the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce themade-in-USA iPhonethat Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.Trump appeared happy enough, for now.\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that woulddouble their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\" The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.For example, Applesaidthat all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made byCorning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up witha $250 millioncommitment in 2019, and $45million in 2021.Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership withTexas Instrumentsto make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are withApplied Materials, a tooling company,GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplyingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.GlobalFoundries manufactures chips forBroadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plantin 2022and committed to buying chips from the factory.Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an ArizonaAmkorfacility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"Trump had a different take.\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments. Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers arecontractually requiredto keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Applesaidin February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate ofabout $70 billion per year. In February, the companycommittedto $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previouslypredicteda made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\" Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRONvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of earningsA bearish 'double top' pattern just formed in the Dow.

However, the latest round of\u00a0industrial restructuring\u00a0appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.The producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.Extreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.However, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.Despite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.He expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.Still, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.China's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.Extreme weather added to the economic strain, with swelteringheatgripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usualdownpourslashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"The property sector has not stabilized. The economy is still supported more by external demand than domestic consumption.

Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"His comments came after Trump announced onTruth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhad been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \"swapping\" territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\"More from NBC News:Trump says ceasefire talks with Putin set for next week in AlaskaWith Zelenskyy sidelined, Trump appears to hand Putin a winRussia claims capture of key Ukrainian stronghold and hits KyivA White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \"decisions against peace,\" adding, \"They will not achieve anything.\"The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday.Russia's demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in each region.It remains unclear whether Trump's reference to \"swapping\" territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side's control.Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \"security guarantees\" from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe sinceWorld War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.In Trump's first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \"got along great\" with him.But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war.Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday.\"The underlying issues have not changed,\" he said. \"For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\" He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \"another step\" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.On the ground, the Kremlin's larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region's prosecutor's office said Saturday.Ukraine's Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/trump-zelenskyy-rejects-ukraine-russia-territory-swap-proposal.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:46:38.134752", "sentiment_score": -0.13220000267028809, "symbol": "COST"}

Both gold spot and futures fell after the initial surge, when a White House official told Bloomberg that the President would introduce a policy clarifying that imports of gold bars should not be subject to tariffs.

The warning also saw gold-based cryptocurrencies, including Tether GoldXAUT$3,383.35and Paxos Gold(PAXG), briefly top $3,390 before receding. Minting volumes, perRWA.xyzdata, reached $439 million over the week, more than doubling the previous $195 million record seen in 2021.

Switzerland, which refines a large share of the world\u2019s gold despite having no mines of its own, exportedmore than $61 billionworth of the metal to the U.S. over the past year. The move has triggered a political backlash in Switzerland, with some lawmakers calling for the gold sector to shoulder part of the economic fallout.

There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d But on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the possibility of ceding parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Russian forces did not control. \u201cUkrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address\u00a0on Telegram. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the Constitution in Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Zelenskyy also warned that any meeting between Trump and Putin that sidestepped Kyiv risked undermining Kyiv\u2019s long-standing diplomatic principle of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d. \u201cAny decisions that are against us, any decisions that are against Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cIn the coming days, Moscow and Washington will devote themselves to the intensive development of the practical and political parameters of the summit in Alaska.\u201d This will be a \u201cchallenging process\u201d, he added. Western and Ukrainian officials suggested the discussion of territorial concessions echoed plans Putin presented in a meeting in Moscow last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump says talks are under way for \u2018swapping of territories\u2019 in the Ukraine-Russia war Trump briefed European leaders on Witkoff\u2019s meeting in a call on Wednesday, which was joined by Zelenskyy. Senior Ukrainian officials involved in calls with the US and European allies said Putin had floated the plan for Ukraine to cede large swaths of its territory during the three-hour meeting with Witkoff. Another western official said there had been extensive discussions of land swaps. Putin\u2019s proposals had veered little from the maximalist claims to Ukraine he had laid out in 2022, the Ukrainian officials said. Russia\u2019s leader proposed freezing the front line in south-eastern Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including territory not currently controlled by Moscow\u2019s forces, the officials said. Russia controls almost all of Luhansk region and a huge swatch of Donetsk region, but has struggled to capture critical Ukrainian strongholds in the latter despite its summer offensive. The southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where Russian forces have been stuck on the south-eastern side of the Dnipro river would be up for discussion, as would small areas of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions controlled by the Russian military. Moscow could withdraw forces from those regions. A recent Gallup poll suggested that Ukrainians\u2019 support for fighting until victory has hit a new low, with 69 per cent favouring a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible \u2014 a nearly complete reversal from public opinion in 2022. But polls also suggest most Ukrainians are not prepared to formally concede territory in exchange for peace. Putin also demanded Nato membership for Ukraine be taken off the table, although EU membership would still be allowed, the officials said. Ukraine\u2019s military would be limited in size, and Russia would demand western allies not provide Kyiv with long-range weapons. Renouncing Nato membership would be resisted by Ukraine and its European allies, officials said. \u201cIt looks like Munich 1938, when great powers decide the fate of the victim of the aggression,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Ukrainian parliament and an MP in Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party. He called what Putin was offering to end the war \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and said agreement by Zelenskyy \u201cmight cause a social explosion in Ukraine\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments that land could be exchanged came ahead of a planned meeting in the UK involving British foreign secretary David Lammy and US vice-president JD Vance to discuss Ukraine. One person familiar with the matter said Witkoff could attend the meeting at Lammy\u2019s official residence in southern England. Another said Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, could also attend. Trump kicked off a new round of diplomacy last month when he expressed anger with Russia\u2019s continued attacks on Ukraine and gave Putin a 10-day deadline to agree a ceasefire or face US economic penalties. Recommended The Financial Times previously reported that Trump could hit Moscow\u2019s shadow fleet of oil tankers withsanctionsto staunch a stream of petrodollars to Putin\u2019s war chest. The US has also threatened to target importers of Russian oil. Friday marked the passing of Trump\u2019s deadline \u2014 although he said he believed Putin and Zelenskyy were still eager to secure an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

People close to the Ukrainian president told the Financial Times that he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s decision to hold a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week without inviting Ukraine to participate. The prospect of Trump and Putin discussing the war behind closed doors, without Ukrainian representation, has raised deep concerns in Kyiv that the future of Ukraine could be negotiated over its head. On Saturday Zelenskyy was attempting to build a unified position with European leaders to firm up international opposition to any backroom deal that could compromise Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, according to senior officials close to the president. His efforts come as officials from the US, Europe and Ukraine prepare to meet in the UK on Saturday. Zelenskyy has dispatched Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine\u2019s secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, to the talks, which US Vice-President JD Vance will attend. Umerov has led Kyiv\u2019s delegation in each of the three rounds of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul since March. Zelenskyy and his advisers are trying to persuade Trump and his team to adopt what one official called a more \u201crational\u201d approach to Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. There is particular anxiety that Trump could seek a quick resolution to the war by offering Putin territorial concessions, legitimising its illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of huge parts of four mainland regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. On Saturday Ukrainian officials were adamant that the US president did not have the legal or political power to order Ukraine to hand over land. Even if Trump wanted to cut a deal, \u201cnobody here in Ukraine has a legal way to give up territories\u201d, an the official added. In an address the nation on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that a peace deal with Russia could involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d, insisting that Ukrainians \u201cwill not gift their land to the occupier\u201d. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the constitution in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Trump announced on Friday that he would meetPutinin Alaska on August 15, adding that a peace deal would probably involve Kyiv ceding territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both,\u201d Trump said. That idea was dismissed in Kyiv. \u201cUkraine will not accept any agreement made without it, especially one that legitimises Russia\u2019s occupation of its sovereign territory,\u201d said another Ukrainian official. Any such deal would have to be ratified by parliament, officials in Kyiv said. Numerous\u00a0Ukrainian MPs including many from Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party have told the Financial Times that they would not vote on legislation that would see parts of Ukraine handed over to Russia as part of a deal to end the war. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s summit, which will be hosted by UK foreign secretary David Lammy at his country residence outside London, Zelenskyy held calls with several European leaders. Downing Street said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy \u201cagreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war\u201d. Zelenskyy said of his call with Starmer that \u201cwe share the same view on the need for a truly lasting peace for Ukraine and on the danger of Russia\u2019s plan to reduce everything to discussing the impossible\u201d. Following a call with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe see no changes in Russia\u2019s position \u2014 the Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war and still push the idea of \u2018exchanging\u2019 Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favourable positions for Russia to resume the war.\u201d At the summit, European capitals will seek to clarify \u201chow determined\u201d the US administration is in sealing a deal with Putin and whether it is conscious of the implications of any territorial concessions to Russia, one European government official told the FT. Conflicting\u00a0scenarios have been set out by different parts of the Trump administration, with differences between what secretary of state Marco Rubio, US special Envoy Steve Witkoff and even Trump himself had conveyed, the person said. Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that the Russian proposal included a freezing of the frontline in south-eastern Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to pull back from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that it still controlled. Moscow has previously laid claim to the entire Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions despite the two regional capitals remaining under Ukrainian control. Swaths of land controlled by Russian forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions may be up for discussion, the officials said. Leaders in the Baltic states criticised any push to force Ukraine into ceding territory amid worries that the region could be a target for Putin. \u201cIf borders can be changed by force, none are safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the cornerstones of global stability. We will not reward aggression \u2014 not in Ukraine, not anywhere,\u201d Margus Tsahkna, Estonia\u2019s foreign minister, said. Recommended Baiba Bra\u017ee, Latvia\u2019s foreign minister, said: \u201cJust, lasting, dignified peace is what we all want, Ukrainians the most. Such peace must involve Ukraine and uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Ukraine has spent the past few years fortifying big cities in the Donetsk region that Moscow is reportedly demanding Kyiv give up. More than 120,000 people still live in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the two main cities in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk. \u201cIf Ukraine cedes territory without concessions or enforceable guarantees, Russia would then seize fortified defensive lines at no cost,\u201d a former Ukrainian officer who runs analytical group Frontelligence Insight wrote on X. \u201cFrom that position Moscow will renew hostilities with impunity.\u201d Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo, Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Berlin, Anna Gross in London and James Politi in Washington", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/69ab6ad3-826e-4bda-a512-250992d09cae", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:12.434396", "sentiment_score": -0.5577999949455261, "symbol": "TGT"}

On Thursday, the Customs and Border Protection agency had published a ruling, which was first reported by the Financial Times, saying one-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars should beclassified with a customs codethat is subject to tariffs. Its decision stood in sharp contrast to a previous White House statement in April that bullion would be exempt from Trump\u2019s levies. Gold for December delivery dropped by 1 per cent to $3,460 per troy ounce on Friday after the FT reported on the White House\u2019s plan to clarify its tariff.

The US Comex is the world\u2019s largest financial market for bullion, but to function efficiently the market relies on having unfettered access to the physicalgoldmarket centred on London \u2014 which would be threatened by any levies, according to market participants. Many in the gold industry have questioned whether the CBP ruling, which was written in response to an inquiry from a Swiss refiner, could have been a bureaucratic mistake. \u201cThe US has to decide if the White House was wrong in April, or if the CBP is wrong now,\u201d said one executive.

Trump has also signalled he may be willing to offer carve-outs for companies such as Apple that promise to make big investments in the US.

The abrupt removal of the chief of the US government\u2019s tax collection and enforcement agency on Friday caps a period of extraordinary turmoil and turnover at theIRS. Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January there have been four acting commissioners at the IRS prior to the start of Long\u2019s tenure in June. Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, will now become acting commissioner of the IRS. The Treasury department oversees the tax agency so Long was already reporting to Bessent prior to his removal. Long said in a post on X on Friday that he had been tapped to be US ambassador to Iceland: \u201cIt is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\u201d The New York Times first reportedTrumpwas planning to remove Long, who was a former auctioneer, property agent and member of Congress before he took up the post at the IRS. The White House and Treasury did not explain why the president wanted him out of the tax service. A Treasury spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cHis zeal and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to the Federal Government was evident in both the House of Representatives and as part of the Trump Administration. A new candidate for Commissioner will be announced at the appropriate time.\u201d The IRS has shed about a quarter of its workforce since Trump\u2019s second term began as the White House moved rapidly to slash the size of government agencies. The dismissals of IRS staff this year stands in contrast to a boost in funding that former president Joe Biden enacted during his time in office in order to increase the agency\u2019s capacity to audit wealthy taxpayers. Long had recently placed two top IRS officials on administrative leave, said one person familiar with the matter. The New York Times on Thursday reported that Long sent an email to staff telling them they could leave work early on Friday. \u201cPlease enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Reeves hopes promise of fairness will cushion potential Budget tax rises", "content": " Anna GrossandDavid Sheppard PublishedAugust 8 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Rachel Reeves plans to link tax rises in the Budget with a promise of improved living conditions in the longer term, as the chancellor and her team begin drawing up a list of which measures she may tighten in the autumn. The chancellor is keen to try and soften the blow of any revenue raising measures on households, according to people close to her, but economists predict she may need to make drastic changes to fill a hole of around \u00a340bn in the public finances. \u201cThe budget is a moment, but she wants to make sure there\u2019s a bigger economic agenda pushing through,\u201d said one person close to the chancellor. The narrative around improving equity and fairness for working people is seen as key to fending off the threat posed by Nigel Farage, who has attracted former Labour voters with a simple message about economic and national decline, which he has tied to high levels of migration. People close to Reeves said she plans to drip feed announcements in the autumn, including finalising the Northern Powerhouse rail project and introducing fresh legislation to speed up planning for infrastructure projects such as data centres, that speak to the government\u2019s wider goal of improving productivity. Reeves sat down with Sir Keir Starmer this past week to go through which taxes to increase, a task made harder by the pledge not to increase income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. Treasury officials insist the three will not be touched in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge. Reeves is also working through a pile of proposals from Treasury officials for tax increases that economists believe could include measures such as freezing tax bands, raising duties on unhealthy foods and gambling, and even potentially increasing fuel duty. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said if the black hole was only \u00a320-\u00a325bn, this would allow the Treasury to \u201cmake some pretty sensible changes\u201d that would not inflict too much damage on the economy and could fit into a marketable centre-left story. Those measures could include prolonging a freeze on income tax band thresholds \u2014 a measure derided last year as \u201cunfair\u201d by Reeves \u2014 to increase receipts by around \u00a34bn a year, and moves such as increasing duties on unhealthy foods to tackle the obesity crisis. But Smith said if the black hole exceeded \u00a340bn, as many economists fear, the government would need to look at more drastic measures. \u201cThe big political call is whether to break one of the manifesto pledges,\u201d Smith said. Last year, ahead of the election, senior Labour figures were set on ruling out increases to National Insurance and income tax, but wavered for 24 hours before ruling out increases to VAT, according to officials. The UK deploys sales taxes more narrowly than many comparable countries. Broadening the scope of the tax rather than raising it may allow Reeves to claim the pledge is intact. Taxes on the gambling industry look almost certain to increase at the budget, a proposal championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown this week, who wants the \u00a33bn increase on duties paid by online betting groups to fund removing the contentious two-child benefit cap. But many other taxes are in play. Downing Street is keeping an open mind given uncertainty about the scale of the challenge the UK faces in balancing the national books. Starmer has laid down no red lines outside the manifesto pledge, leaving taxes such as fuel duty \u2014 normally seen as politically toxic \u2014 as an option, economists say. Increasing fuel duty would align with the wider Labour narrative about investing in net zero and electrification, though the level has been frozen for more than a decade. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour was \u201cgearing up to punish the British public with more tax rises\u201d. People close to the PM insist the plan for the autumn is not a \u201creset\u201d despite Labour enduring a difficult first year in office, which has left it trailing Reform UK in the polls. Starmer remains focused on boosting the economy, they say, and is desperate to accelerate progress in areas like planning reform. Mujtaba Rahman at Eurasia Group questioned, however, whether voters would really think that a message of \u201cfairness\u201d would sweeten the sour note of higher taxes enough. \u201cAt times this feels like a government in search of a narrative.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/297b01f4-e629-4811-8726-aed9dceea334", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:16.860632", "sentiment_score": 0.20839999616146088, "symbol": "ARE"}

Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,\u201d Altman promised. Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote. And Altman also promised, \u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.\u201d\u00a0This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.

The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar. Altman didn\u2019t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a \u201cmega chart screwup\u201don X. Others noted the charts in thepublished blog post were correct. But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model\u2019s performance,also pointed outthat turning data into a table was \u201cgood example of a GPT-5 failure.\u201d In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most.

Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous postson social mediaurging users to turn off location sharing,incorrectly claimingthat it\u2019s automatically turned on. \u201cWe\u2019re double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\u201d Mosseri said in aThreads post. \u201cWe\u2019re still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\u201d Mosseri also said that somepeople are \u201cconfused\u201dabout how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. It\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you\u2019re still at the location). If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn\u2019t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps below. To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new \u201cMap\u201d option at the top. If it\u2019s your first time accessing the feature, you\u2019ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads \u201cWho can see your location.\u201d From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the \u201cStory, live and location\u201d option, and then tap the \u201cLocation sharing\u201d button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you\u2019ll be able to see them on the Map. When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you\u2019ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or \u201cNotes,\u201d on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they\u2019re shared with a location.

Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, likea shark wearing sneakersanda ballerina with a cappuccino for a head. One startup driving this trend isOpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users. The company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising. With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden. Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion. The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy. While these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation. During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June,Disney and Universalsued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder. \u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters. One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent. \u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said. Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app. OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member. OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users\u2019 interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. \u201cI think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything\u00a0\u2026\u201d Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,\u201d he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn\u2019t talk about it that way, usually, because it\u2019s not how users think of it. \u201cBut when users say things like \u2018Pinterest just gets me,\u2019 it\u2019s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they\u2019re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,\u201d he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a \u201cCambrian moment,\u201d and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch anew set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention ofmass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn\u2019t say if that\u2019s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including onFacebook,Instagram, andTumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that\u2019s used for good and used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d \u201cOn the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cBoth in terms of what we\u2019re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what\u2019s happening in the rest of social media,\u201d he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle. The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customerswent bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May,Bloomberg reportedthat SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy. Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "How Tim Cook convinced Trump to drop made-in-USA iPhone \u2014 for now", "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with President Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S.But a closer look at Apple's announcements suggest that what Cook disclosed was an update to its U.S. strategy, not a major break.Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trumphas made clear that he wantsAppleto make iPhones in the U.S.Apple CEOTim Cookis doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.Cook on Wednesdayappearedat the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce themade-in-USA iPhonethat Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.Trump appeared happy enough, for now.\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that woulddouble their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\" The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.For example, Applesaidthat all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made byCorning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up witha $250 millioncommitment in 2019, and $45million in 2021.Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership withTexas Instrumentsto make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are withApplied Materials, a tooling company,GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplyingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.GlobalFoundries manufactures chips forBroadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plantin 2022and committed to buying chips from the factory.Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an ArizonaAmkorfacility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"Trump had a different take.\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments. Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers arecontractually requiredto keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Applesaidin February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate ofabout $70 billion per year. In February, the companycommittedto $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previouslypredicteda made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\" Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRONvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of earningsA bearish 'double top' pattern just formed in the Dow.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "China's July factory-gate prices miss forecast, deflation concerns persist", "content": "China's producer prices fell more than expected in July, while consumer prices were unchanged, underscoring the impact of sluggish domestic demand and persistent trade uncertainty on consumer and business sentiment.Factory-gate prices have been declining for more than two years, and Saturday's data suggest early-stage efforts to tackle price competition have yet to yield significant results.Deflationary pressures have prompted Chinese authorities to address overcapacity in key industries. However, the latest round of\u00a0industrial restructuring\u00a0appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.The producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.Extreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.However, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.Despite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.He expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.Still, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.China's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.Extreme weather added to the economic strain, with swelteringheatgripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usualdownpourslashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"The property sector has not stabilized. The economy is still supported more by external demand than domestic consumption.

Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"His comments came after Trump announced onTruth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhad been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \"swapping\" territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\"More from NBC News:Trump says ceasefire talks with Putin set for next week in AlaskaWith Zelenskyy sidelined, Trump appears to hand Putin a winRussia claims capture of key Ukrainian stronghold and hits KyivA White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \"decisions against peace,\" adding, \"They will not achieve anything.\"The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday.Russia's demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in each region.It remains unclear whether Trump's reference to \"swapping\" territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side's control.Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \"security guarantees\" from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe sinceWorld War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.In Trump's first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \"got along great\" with him.But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war.Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday.\"The underlying issues have not changed,\" he said. \"For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\" He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \"another step\" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.On the ground, the Kremlin's larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region's prosecutor's office said Saturday.Ukraine's Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/trump-zelenskyy-rejects-ukraine-russia-territory-swap-proposal.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:40:54.475021", "sentiment_score": -0.13220000267028809, "symbol": "COST"}

The warning also saw gold-based cryptocurrencies, including Tether GoldXAUT$3,383.35and Paxos Gold(PAXG), briefly top $3,390 before receding.

People close to the Ukrainian president told the Financial Times that he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s decision to hold a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week without inviting Ukraine to participate. The prospect of Trump and Putin discussing the war behind closed doors, without Ukrainian representation, has raised deep concerns in Kyiv that the future of Ukraine could be negotiated over its head. On Saturday Zelenskyy was attempting to build a unified position with European leaders to firm up international opposition to any backroom deal that could compromise Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, according to senior officials close to the president. His efforts come as officials from the US, Europe and Ukraine prepare to meet in the UK on Saturday. Zelenskyy has dispatched Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine\u2019s secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, to the talks, which US Vice-President JD Vance will attend. Umerov has led Kyiv\u2019s delegation in each of the three rounds of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul since March. Zelenskyy and his advisers are trying to persuade Trump and his team to adopt what one official called a more \u201crational\u201d approach to Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. There is particular anxiety that Trump could seek a quick resolution to the war by offering Putin territorial concessions, legitimising its illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of huge parts of four mainland regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. On Saturday Ukrainian officials were adamant that the US president did not have the legal or political power to order Ukraine to hand over land. Even if Trump wanted to cut a deal, \u201cnobody here in Ukraine has a legal way to give up territories\u201d, an the official added. In an address the nation on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that a peace deal with Russia could involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d, insisting that Ukrainians \u201cwill not gift their land to the occupier\u201d. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the constitution in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Trump announced on Friday that he would meetPutinin Alaska on August 15, adding that a peace deal would probably involve Kyiv ceding territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both,\u201d Trump said. That idea was dismissed in Kyiv. \u201cUkraine will not accept any agreement made without it, especially one that legitimises Russia\u2019s occupation of its sovereign territory,\u201d said another Ukrainian official. Any such deal would have to be ratified by parliament, officials in Kyiv said. Numerous\u00a0Ukrainian MPs including many from Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party have told the Financial Times that they would not vote on legislation that would see parts of Ukraine handed over to Russia as part of a deal to end the war. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s summit, which will be hosted by UK foreign secretary David Lammy at his country residence outside London, Zelenskyy held calls with several European leaders. Downing Street said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy \u201cagreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war\u201d. Zelenskyy said of his call with Starmer that \u201cwe share the same view on the need for a truly lasting peace for Ukraine and on the danger of Russia\u2019s plan to reduce everything to discussing the impossible\u201d. Following a call with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe see no changes in Russia\u2019s position \u2014 the Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war and still push the idea of \u2018exchanging\u2019 Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favourable positions for Russia to resume the war.\u201d At the summit, European capitals will seek to clarify \u201chow determined\u201d the US administration is in sealing a deal with Putin and whether it is conscious of the implications of any territorial concessions to Russia, one European government official told the FT. Conflicting\u00a0scenarios have been set out by different parts of the Trump administration, with differences between what secretary of state Marco Rubio, US special Envoy Steve Witkoff and even Trump himself had conveyed, the person said. Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that the Russian proposal included a freezing of the frontline in south-eastern Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to pull back from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that it still controlled. Moscow has previously laid claim to the entire Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions despite the two regional capitals remaining under Ukrainian control. Swaths of land controlled by Russian forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions may be up for discussion, the officials said. Leaders in the Baltic states criticised any push to force Ukraine into ceding territory amid worries that the region could be a target for Putin. \u201cIf borders can be changed by force, none are safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the cornerstones of global stability. We will not reward aggression \u2014 not in Ukraine, not anywhere,\u201d Margus Tsahkna, Estonia\u2019s foreign minister, said. Recommended Baiba Bra\u017ee, Latvia\u2019s foreign minister, said: \u201cJust, lasting, dignified peace is what we all want, Ukrainians the most. Such peace must involve Ukraine and uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Ukraine has spent the past few years fortifying big cities in the Donetsk region that Moscow is reportedly demanding Kyiv give up. More than 120,000 people still live in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the two main cities in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk. \u201cIf Ukraine cedes territory without concessions or enforceable guarantees, Russia would then seize fortified defensive lines at no cost,\u201d a former Ukrainian officer who runs analytical group Frontelligence Insight wrote on X. \u201cFrom that position Moscow will renew hostilities with impunity.\u201d Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo, Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Berlin, Anna Gross in London and James Politi in Washington", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/69ab6ad3-826e-4bda-a512-250992d09cae", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:41:21.522593", "sentiment_score": -0.5577999949455261, "symbol": "TGT"}

A lot of Ukrainians have died,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d But on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the possibility of ceding parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Russian forces did not control. \u201cUkrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address\u00a0on Telegram. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the Constitution in Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Zelenskyy also warned that any meeting between Trump and Putin that sidestepped Kyiv risked undermining Kyiv\u2019s long-standing diplomatic principle of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d. \u201cAny decisions that are against us, any decisions that are against Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cIn the coming days, Moscow and Washington will devote themselves to the intensive development of the practical and political parameters of the summit in Alaska.\u201d This will be a \u201cchallenging process\u201d, he added. Western and Ukrainian officials suggested the discussion of territorial concessions echoed plans Putin presented in a meeting in Moscow last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump says talks are under way for \u2018swapping of territories\u2019 in the Ukraine-Russia war Trump briefed European leaders on Witkoff\u2019s meeting in a call on Wednesday, which was joined by Zelenskyy. Senior Ukrainian officials involved in calls with the US and European allies said Putin had floated the plan for Ukraine to cede large swaths of its territory during the three-hour meeting with Witkoff. Another western official said there had been extensive discussions of land swaps. Putin\u2019s proposals had veered little from the maximalist claims to Ukraine he had laid out in 2022, the Ukrainian officials said. Russia\u2019s leader proposed freezing the front line in south-eastern Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including territory not currently controlled by Moscow\u2019s forces, the officials said. Russia controls almost all of Luhansk region and a huge swatch of Donetsk region, but has struggled to capture critical Ukrainian strongholds in the latter despite its summer offensive. The southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where Russian forces have been stuck on the south-eastern side of the Dnipro river would be up for discussion, as would small areas of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions controlled by the Russian military. Moscow could withdraw forces from those regions. A recent Gallup poll suggested that Ukrainians\u2019 support for fighting until victory has hit a new low, with 69 per cent favouring a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible \u2014 a nearly complete reversal from public opinion in 2022. But polls also suggest most Ukrainians are not prepared to formally concede territory in exchange for peace. Putin also demanded Nato membership for Ukraine be taken off the table, although EU membership would still be allowed, the officials said. Ukraine\u2019s military would be limited in size, and Russia would demand western allies not provide Kyiv with long-range weapons. Renouncing Nato membership would be resisted by Ukraine and its European allies, officials said. \u201cIt looks like Munich 1938, when great powers decide the fate of the victim of the aggression,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Ukrainian parliament and an MP in Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party. He called what Putin was offering to end the war \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and said agreement by Zelenskyy \u201cmight cause a social explosion in Ukraine\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments that land could be exchanged came ahead of a planned meeting in the UK involving British foreign secretary David Lammy and US vice-president JD Vance to discuss Ukraine. One person familiar with the matter said Witkoff could attend the meeting at Lammy\u2019s official residence in southern England. Another said Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, could also attend. Trump kicked off a new round of diplomacy last month when he expressed anger with Russia\u2019s continued attacks on Ukraine and gave Putin a 10-day deadline to agree a ceasefire or face US economic penalties. Recommended The Financial Times previously reported that Trump could hit Moscow\u2019s shadow fleet of oil tankers withsanctionsto staunch a stream of petrodollars to Putin\u2019s war chest. The US has also threatened to target importers of Russian oil. Friday marked the passing of Trump\u2019s deadline \u2014 although he said he believed Putin and Zelenskyy were still eager to secure an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

On Thursday, the Customs and Border Protection agency had published a ruling, which was first reported by the Financial Times, saying one-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars should beclassified with a customs codethat is subject to tariffs. Its decision stood in sharp contrast to a previous White House statement in April that bullion would be exempt from Trump\u2019s levies. Gold for December delivery dropped by 1 per cent to $3,460 per troy ounce on Friday after the FT reported on the White House\u2019s plan to clarify its tariff.

The US Comex is the world\u2019s largest financial market for bullion, but to function efficiently the market relies on having unfettered access to the physicalgoldmarket centred on London \u2014 which would be threatened by any levies, according to market participants. Many in the gold industry have questioned whether the CBP ruling, which was written in response to an inquiry from a Swiss refiner, could have been a bureaucratic mistake. \u201cThe US has to decide if the White House was wrong in April, or if the CBP is wrong now,\u201d said one executive. Switzerland was dealt a particularly heavy blow as a result of the US\u2019s tariffs decision, since the country is the world\u2019s largest refining hub. The tariff ruling would \u201cnegatively impact\u201d the flow of physical gold around the world, noted the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders in Precious Metals Association in astatementon Friday. Trump reignited his global trade war earlier this week by reimposing his reciprocaltariffson almost every US trading partner, pushing American import duties to their highest level in decades. But the US president has also offered a host of exemptions to the levies, including to products such as pharmaceuticals or chips, that the US may apply separate tariffs to in future. In April, the US issued further exemptions to a range of consumer electronics such as laptops, smartphones and earphones. Trump has also signalled he may be willing to offer carve-outs for companies such as Apple that promise to make big investments in the US.

The abrupt removal of the chief of the US government\u2019s tax collection and enforcement agency on Friday caps a period of extraordinary turmoil and turnover at theIRS. Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January there have been four acting commissioners at the IRS prior to the start of Long\u2019s tenure in June. Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, will now become acting commissioner of the IRS. The Treasury department oversees the tax agency so Long was already reporting to Bessent prior to his removal. Long said in a post on X on Friday that he had been tapped to be US ambassador to Iceland: \u201cIt is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\u201d The New York Times first reportedTrumpwas planning to remove Long, who was a former auctioneer, property agent and member of Congress before he took up the post at the IRS. The White House and Treasury did not explain why the president wanted him out of the tax service. A Treasury spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cHis zeal and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to the Federal Government was evident in both the House of Representatives and as part of the Trump Administration. A new candidate for Commissioner will be announced at the appropriate time.\u201d The IRS has shed about a quarter of its workforce since Trump\u2019s second term began as the White House moved rapidly to slash the size of government agencies. The dismissals of IRS staff this year stands in contrast to a boost in funding that former president Joe Biden enacted during his time in office in order to increase the agency\u2019s capacity to audit wealthy taxpayers. Long had recently placed two top IRS officials on administrative leave, said one person familiar with the matter. The New York Times on Thursday reported that Long sent an email to staff telling them they could leave work early on Friday. \u201cPlease enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Reeves hopes promise of fairness will cushion potential Budget tax rises", "content": " Anna GrossandDavid Sheppard PublishedAugust 8 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Rachel Reeves plans to link tax rises in the Budget with a promise of improved living conditions in the longer term, as the chancellor and her team begin drawing up a list of which measures she may tighten in the autumn. The chancellor is keen to try and soften the blow of any revenue raising measures on households, according to people close to her, but economists predict she may need to make drastic changes to fill a hole of around \u00a340bn in the public finances. \u201cThe budget is a moment, but she wants to make sure there\u2019s a bigger economic agenda pushing through,\u201d said one person close to the chancellor. The narrative around improving equity and fairness for working people is seen as key to fending off the threat posed by Nigel Farage, who has attracted former Labour voters with a simple message about economic and national decline, which he has tied to high levels of migration. People close to Reeves said she plans to drip feed announcements in the autumn, including finalising the Northern Powerhouse rail project and introducing fresh legislation to speed up planning for infrastructure projects such as data centres, that speak to the government\u2019s wider goal of improving productivity. Reeves sat down with Sir Keir Starmer this past week to go through which taxes to increase, a task made harder by the pledge not to increase income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. Treasury officials insist the three will not be touched in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge. Reeves is also working through a pile of proposals from Treasury officials for tax increases that economists believe could include measures such as freezing tax bands, raising duties on unhealthy foods and gambling, and even potentially increasing fuel duty. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said if the black hole was only \u00a320-\u00a325bn, this would allow the Treasury to \u201cmake some pretty sensible changes\u201d that would not inflict too much damage on the economy and could fit into a marketable centre-left story. Those measures could include prolonging a freeze on income tax band thresholds \u2014 a measure derided last year as \u201cunfair\u201d by Reeves \u2014 to increase receipts by around \u00a34bn a year, and moves such as increasing duties on unhealthy foods to tackle the obesity crisis. But Smith said if the black hole exceeded \u00a340bn, as many economists fear, the government would need to look at more drastic measures. \u201cThe big political call is whether to break one of the manifesto pledges,\u201d Smith said. Last year, ahead of the election, senior Labour figures were set on ruling out increases to National Insurance and income tax, but wavered for 24 hours before ruling out increases to VAT, according to officials. The UK deploys sales taxes more narrowly than many comparable countries. Broadening the scope of the tax rather than raising it may allow Reeves to claim the pledge is intact. Taxes on the gambling industry look almost certain to increase at the budget, a proposal championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown this week, who wants the \u00a33bn increase on duties paid by online betting groups to fund removing the contentious two-child benefit cap. But many other taxes are in play. Downing Street is keeping an open mind given uncertainty about the scale of the challenge the UK faces in balancing the national books. Starmer has laid down no red lines outside the manifesto pledge, leaving taxes such as fuel duty \u2014 normally seen as politically toxic \u2014 as an option, economists say. Increasing fuel duty would align with the wider Labour narrative about investing in net zero and electrification, though the level has been frozen for more than a decade. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour was \u201cgearing up to punish the British public with more tax rises\u201d. People close to the PM insist the plan for the autumn is not a \u201creset\u201d despite Labour enduring a difficult first year in office, which has left it trailing Reform UK in the polls. Starmer remains focused on boosting the economy, they say, and is desperate to accelerate progress in areas like planning reform. Mujtaba Rahman at Eurasia Group questioned, however, whether voters would really think that a message of \u201cfairness\u201d would sweeten the sour note of higher taxes enough. \u201cAt times this feels like a government in search of a narrative.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/297b01f4-e629-4811-8726-aed9dceea334", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:41:28.166588", "sentiment_score": 0.20839999616146088, "symbol": "ARE"}

Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous postson social mediaurging users to turn off location sharing,incorrectly claimingthat it\u2019s automatically turned on. \u201cWe\u2019re double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\u201d Mosseri said in aThreads post. \u201cWe\u2019re still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\u201d Mosseri also said that somepeople are \u201cconfused\u201dabout how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. It\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you\u2019re still at the location). If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn\u2019t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps below. To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new \u201cMap\u201d option at the top. If it\u2019s your first time accessing the feature, you\u2019ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads \u201cWho can see your location.\u201d From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the \u201cStory, live and location\u201d option, and then tap the \u201cLocation sharing\u201d button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you\u2019ll be able to see them on the Map. When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you\u2019ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or \u201cNotes,\u201d on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they\u2019re shared with a location.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Former Googlers\u2019 AI startup OpenArt now creates \u2018brain rot\u2019 videos in just one click", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us AI-generated \u201cbrain rot\u201d videos are popping up all over the internet and getting a lot of attention. Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, likea shark wearing sneakersanda ballerina with a cappuccino for a head. One startup driving this trend isOpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users. The company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising. With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden. Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion. The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy. While these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation. During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June,Disney and Universalsued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder. \u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters. One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent. \u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said. Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app. OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member. OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey \u2014 around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases. Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users\u2019 interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. \u201cI think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything\u00a0\u2026\u201d Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,\u201d he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn\u2019t talk about it that way, usually, because it\u2019s not how users think of it. \u201cBut when users say things like \u2018Pinterest just gets me,\u2019 it\u2019s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they\u2019re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,\u201d he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a \u201cCambrian moment,\u201d and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch anew set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention ofmass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn\u2019t say if that\u2019s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including onFacebook,Instagram, andTumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that\u2019s used for good and used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d \u201cOn the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cBoth in terms of what we\u2019re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what\u2019s happening in the rest of social media,\u201d he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle. The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customerswent bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May,Bloomberg reportedthat SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously \u2014 a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,\" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.Top TV picks on CNBC Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does \"very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.\" India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs maydiminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S.relative their peers in the region.\u2013 Amala BalakrishnerIn the marketsIndian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.Both the benchmarkNifty 50and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:45:00.675916", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump calls on Intel chief to resign", "content": " Tim Bradshawin London andDemetri Sevastopuloin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world US President Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d The post did not detail Tan\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, amid a radical cost-cutting programme, Tanwarnedlast month that Intel might be forced to abandon development of its next-generation manufacturing technology if it were unable to secure a \u201csignificant external customer\u201d. Such a move would hand a virtual monopoly of leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC. \u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in Tuesday\u2019sletterto Intel\u2019s board chair, Frank Yeary. \u201cMr Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfil these obligations.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Acton in San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a36a7c6-8959-42b0-bdca-e8f49cb0c342", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:01.132919", "sentiment_score": -0.6980000138282776, "symbol": "CDNS"}

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:04.494387", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}

The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-07T23:46:05.986946", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

Miran, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announced plans to leave the central bank months before her term was set to end in January. The US president said in a Truth Social post on Thursday thatMiranwould serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The Senate must confirm Miran\u2019s nomination to the Fed board. The legislative body approved his appointment to the CEA by 53 votes to 46 in March. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised chair Jay Powell for the central bank\u2019s refusal to cut borrowing costs this year. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation before cutting rates from a current range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman both dissented with the Fed\u2019s July decision to hold rates steady. Trump is widely expected to ultimately use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Feds, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked an broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed.

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "AI agents aren\u2019t the \u2018new Google,\u2019 says Airbnb CEO", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After a second-quarter earningsbeat, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared his thoughts on the company\u2019s AI strategy, cautioning investors that AI chatbots can\u2019t yet be thought of as the \u201cnew Google.\u201d That is, AI chatbots, while potentially driving new leads to the travel and services business, aren\u2019t entirely a replacement for the referrals that the dominant search engine brings. At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. The big storyIf refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed \u2014 and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S.,bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: \"They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then\u2026 then I'm not going to be happy.\"Despite Trump's tone, \"while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,\" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. \"What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals.\"After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhipreviously enjoyed the White House's blessingto access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.\"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,\" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, \"we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"He added: \"In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.\"If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, \"global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around5.2 million barrels per day\u2014 including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant \u2014 and the International Energy Agencyexpectsthe country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product \u2014 think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil \u2014 many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called \"sour\") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf\u2026 and Russia's Urals.But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo \u2014 but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis \u2014 leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.\"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,\" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments.\"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat \u2014 logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,\" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has beenattempting tostave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs \u2014 the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies \u2014 could burden that mission.But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a \"flurry\" of tenders to buy spot crude.A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply \u2013 and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.\"It is important to note that crude from the Middle\u00a0East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,\" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. \"Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations.\"Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (\"sweet\") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether \u2014 though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decidedon a September production hikecounted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.\"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs.

He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't \"really behave in the same way\" as China's.Need to knowTrump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India.This brings thetotal levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set totake effect on Thursday.Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter \"fueling\" Russia's war machine.Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediatelycould cause a spikein global crude oil prices.Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars.Investment house UBS estimates that$8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerableto the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "Trump's latest chip tariff declaration raises more questions than answers", "content": "Trump says he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"Experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not forcompaniesthat are \"building in the United States.\"As semiconductors represent anover $600 billion industryat the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\"\u00a0 Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\" One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such asTSMCandSamsung Electronicshave committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMCannouncedit would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs. Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at\u00a0 Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to theInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation.While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started anational security investigationof semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector wasexemptedfrom Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers likeAmazonWeb Services andGoogle, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.According to a recentreportfrom ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S.,AppleCEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/trump-100-percent-chip-tariff-threat-leaves-more-questions-than-answers.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:24.184414", "sentiment_score": -0.02630000002682209, "symbol": "QCOM"}

Currently the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Miran is presumably an ally of the president and for now probably likely to at least partially share his dovish views on the current level of interest rates. Even prior to the Miran selection, a series of Fed speakers over past days \u2014 reacting to Friday's weak jobs numbers and Monday's soft ISM Services print \u2014 made clear their expectation that a rate cut is likely coming at the central bank's next meeting in September.

But it came after aletter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, to Intel\u2019s board chair expressing \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations\u201d and Tan\u2019s ties to China. It also came one day after Trump met Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the White House. The White House did not say whether the president\u2019s post was related to the concerns raised by Cotton. But a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country\u2019s national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\u201d Later on Thursday Intel said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,\u201d it added. Tan has been a prolific investor in Chinese tech companies through his San Francisco-based venture capital firm as well as companies based in Hong Kong. His past investments have included Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip manufacturer. Before being appointed Intel CEO earlier this year, Tan ran California-based Cadence Design Systems, which last week admitted to violating US export controls by selling its chip design tools to a Chinese university with close ties to the military. Intelshares fell 3.1 per cent in New York on Thursday. Tan was appointed as Intel CEO in March after the Silicon Valley company\u2019s board ousted his predecessor Pat Gelsinger in December. Intel is the only US-headquartered company capable of producing advanced semiconductors, though it has so far largely missed out on the current boom for artificial intelligence chips. It has been awarded billions of dollars in US government subsidies and loans to support its chip manufacturing business, which has fallen far behind its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawmakers are calling for the cancellation of a contentious order of three dozen F-35 fighter jets in response to Trump\u2019s unexpectedly high tariffs on Swiss goods. The proposal, backed by lawmakers from multiple parties, reflects growing frustration over what they view as unfair economic pressure from Washington. The Swiss government on Thursday defended the arms deal and said it would continue talks with the US for a better trade agreement. The UKrecently announcedthat it would buy F-35A models for the Royal Air Force to add an air strike capability to its nuclear arsenal. Spain does not own any F-35s, but there had been speculation before last year\u2019s US presidential election that Madrid would choose the Lockheed jet for its future needs. The move to buy European aircraft was \u201cunsurprising\u201d given disagreements between Spain and the US on issues ranging from defence spending to China, said Michael Walsh, a US foreign policy expert and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere would have been a tremendous political risk of the Trump administration using an F-35 purchase as leverage to push the Sanchez administration to align itself with US national security and foreign policy interests. The Spanish government would have been aware of that.\u201dThe opposition People\u2019s party called for Spain\u2019s defence minister Margarita Robles to appear before congress to explain the decision to opt for European aircraft. Cuca Gamarra, a senior PP lawmaker, said: \u201cWe are witnessing yet another example of the S\u00e1nchez government\u2019s core doctrine, which prioritises sectarianism and confrontation with the United States over the general interest and even the country\u2019s security.\u201d Spain\u2019s decision was first reported by El Pa\u00eds.The F-35, known as a fifth generation jet, is the world\u2019s only advanced, long-range stealth fighter and forms the backbone of many modern western air forces. It is used by the US as well as 19 allied nations, including some non-Nato members such as Japan. Spain needs to replace part of its fleets of AV-8B Harrier and F-18 fighter jets, which are due to be retired in the 2030s. In 2023, Spain agreed to buy 25 more Eurofighter jets made by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, increasing the size of its Eurofighter fleet to 115. But the jets cannot match the functionality of the F-35s and are considered 4.5th generation fighters. They are assembled at an Airbus facility close to Madrid and are due to be delivered between 2026 and 2030. The FCAS joint programme between France, Germany and Spain is still in its early stages, and has been subject lately tosquabblingbetween the companies involved \u2014 Airbus, Dassault Aviation, and Indra \u2014 which they say could put the project at risk. FCAS will be a fuller system than the Eurofighter, coupling a more powerful fighter with drones and more integrated software. If the three countries and their defence contractors can overcome differences to continue development, then FCAS would come into service in 2040 at the earliest.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Trump to nominate Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board", "content": " Claire Jonesin Washington PublishedAugust 7 2025 UpdatedAugust 8 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has said he will nominate Stephen Miran to temporarily join the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors \u2014 a move that would bring a critic of chair Jay Powell on to the central bank\u2019s policy-setting panel. Miran, chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and a crucial Trump ally, is one of the architects of the president\u2019stariff policy. Miran has argued that the US\u2019s sweeping levies would not be inflationary, a view that clashes with that of Powell and several other top Fed officials. Miran will take the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who last week announcedplans to leave the central bankmonths before her term was set to end in January. He will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday that Miran would serve through to the end of January as the administration continues its search for a \u201cpermanent replacement\u201d to fill the seat. The shake-up at theFedcomes as Trump has harshly criticised Powell for the central bank\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold this year, with the president calling for a reduction of as much as 3 percentage points. Powell has said the Fed needs to assess the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs oninflationbefore cutting rates from the current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent. Miran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and was previously a policy adviser at the Treasury department, will get a vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Economists broadly expect him to join fellow Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in supporting the president\u2019s calls for rate cuts. Waller and Bowman dissented with the Fed\u2019s decision in July to hold rates steady, calling for immediate cuts in borrowing costs. Miran said in a television interview on Thursday that many Fed officials were suffering from \u201ctariff derangement syndrome\u201d because of their views that tariffs would increase inflation. He has argued that Trump\u2019s overall fiscal policies were \u201cextremely disinflationary\u201d, easing the need for high rates. He has also criticised Powell for advocating for fiscal stimulus measures to fight the economic ructions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Miran has said the Fed chief has moved too slowly on adjusting monetary policy. JPMorgan said after Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it now expects a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September. Some economists had already begun to pencil in a reduction in borrowing costs next month following data last week that pointed to asharp slowdown in hiringthis summer. \u201cGiven his support of Trump\u2019s policies, we think Miran would likely continue to act as a Trump loyalist once on the Fed board, calling for lower rates and voting for rate cuts in FOMC meetings,\u201d said Marco Casiraghi, an economist at Evercore ISI. Trump is widely expected to use the seat that will be filled by Miran until January as a means to replace Powell as Fed chair. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026, but he can stay on the Fed board until January 2028. Recommended Before joining the Trump administration, Miran had advocated for reform of the US central bank, including shorter term lengths for officials and making the 12 regional Fed banks, which are set up like private corporations, public bodies. He also wanted to make it easier to fire Fed officials and halt a \u201crevolving door\u201d between the central bank and the White House. In a document published by the Manhattan Institute think-tank, Miran said the Fed\u2019s institutional design had \u201cmorphed into unchecked and broad-ranging authority, tempting the Fed into straying beyond its democratically bounded role\u201d. Several Trump administration officials, including the Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have called for an overhaul of the governance of the Fed. The Fed declined to comment.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/298bf95e-49ec-4d9f-8948-b7f72cf4ffdd", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:52.021026", "sentiment_score": -0.7980999946594238, "symbol": "ARE"}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The kernels of truth in reports of a millionaires\u2019 exodus", "content": " Chris Giles PublishedAugust 7 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Summer often brings the pleasure of absurd unsolicited publicity emails from tax advisers. My favourite so far has been Blick Rothenberg\u2019s news that people pay income tax on earnings, oras the company put it: \u201cHMRC Nets Over \u00a3750k from Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2025 Win.\u201d The most popular current complaint is that there is an exodus from the UK of rich people disgusted by chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax plans. The best-known survey on the topic comes annually fromHenley & Partners, with data from New World Wealth, a consultancy in South Africa. It claims to calculate net millionaire migration for many countries. The UK came bottom of this league in 2025, with a net 16,500 millionaires said to be fleeing Reeves\u2019 tax grabs. The accuracy of these estimates has beenconvincingly debunked(withhelp from FT reporters) by Dan Neidle, who founded the Tax Policy Associates think-tank. Despite a statistical drubbing as brutal as this, Labour would be unwise to conclude that its tax policies are fine, or that it should shore up the UK\u2019s public finances with a new soak-the-rich wealth tax. Neither Henley & Partners, which advises people seeking residency and citizenship abroad, nor anyone else can know how many millionaires are leaving the UK because the data simply does not exist. It is difficult enough knowing how many millionaires live in the UK since the Wealth and Assets Survey was deemedofficially unreliablein June. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one is going. There is corroborating evidence, hard to ignore, of a net flow of wealthy people out of the UK and a correlation with significantly higher taxes on those with the broadest shoulders. The FT has undertaken arigorous attemptto look at the departures of company directors, but the data behind this can only represent a small sample of behavioural responses. It comes alongside a lot of anecdotal evidence. Whether it is the dip in demand forbutlers,poor returnson the most expensive prime London property,financial worriesat exclusive private members\u2019 clubs orreports from wealth managers, the London of the super-rich is less comfortable than it was. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected a quarter of the richest taxpayers with non-dom status to leave the UK following the last Budget, noting that estimates are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Mayfair flats and stuffy clubs may not be that important for a UK economy at close to full employment. But a country withprecarious public financesshould not be blas\u00e9 about any rich person emigrating. The UK would not lose much in tax from a Middle Eastern, non-dom billionaire who only pays consumption taxes on services bought on occasional visits. But it loses a lot when high-earning bankers return to live in the US or France while staying in the same jobs. Given their mobility, it\u2019s unlikely that much more tax revenue can be squeezed from the very rich. Forecasts from the non-dom tax changes in last Autumn\u2019s Budget were small, with the OBR estimating anaverage haul for the taxpayerof \u00a34bn a year between 2026-27 and 2028-29 before the additional revenues disappear. Any UK government that wants to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d has to remember that there is a lot of yelping already. Earnings of the top 10 per cent and top 1 per centhave been fallingcompared with the UK average since 2010 as the proportion of tax they pay has risen. Wealth is alreadytaxed more highlythan in other advanced economies, with onerous property, transaction and inheritance taxes. It is reasonable to dismiss studies warning of an exodus of rich people from the UK as statistically unsound. But the Labour government should not ignore the wider evidence that the UK\u2019s tax base has narrowed. It is risking a genuine exodus of the wealthy and that would be terrible for the public finances. chris.giles@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a24be5e-395e-43db-a91f-4b4f02d99f1a", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:53.536187", "sentiment_score": -0.16940000653266907, "symbol": "NWSA"}

The increases were implemented despite frantic lobbying by foreign capitals to escape the levies driving Trump\u2019s economic agenda, as a seven-day grace period from the president\u2019s announcement last week ofthe latest versionof the regime elapsed. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter flew home from Washington on Wednesday after failing in a last-ditch attempt to evade some of Trump\u2019s harshestduties. Taiwan, a crucial chips exporter, also failed to cut its tariff rate. Trump\u2019s new terms followed months of threats and reversals, and involve so-called reciprocal levies on almost all foreign countries, as the president moved to reshape an international trading system developed over decades. \u201cThis is a big deal, in the sense that there are new official tariffs,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer at Sidley Austin in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because these tariffs have upended things. This is the dawn of a new trade order, and the end of an old order.\u201d Other trade analysts pointed out the array of new levies now facing the US\u2019s trading partners. \u201cWe are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,\u201d said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The reciprocal tariffs will raise levies even on economies with new US trade deals, including the EU and Japan. China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is separate: itstrade war trucewith Washington ends on August 12. While Mexico has also agreed a pause in any new tariffs for 90 days,steep new levies on Canada\u2014 the US\u2019s other partner in a North American trade group \u2014 have already come into effect. Trump has also said he will soon announce other tariffs on pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, and other sectors, which are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday, he indicated he wouldhit chip importswith a tariff of 100 per cent, although he did not say when, and also held out the possibility of carve-outs for companies that invested in the US. The reciprocal regime took force just hours after the US steepened forthcomingtariffs on Indiato punish it for buying Russian oil \u2014 showing Trump remains ready to use his trade war to pursue geopolitical goals. \u201cBILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly before the overnight tariff deadline passed. The August 7 tariff regime marks the second time the president has instructed US customs to apply the sweeping reciprocal levies. In early April, he pushed ahead with his levies before partially suspending them. Although Trump\u2019s latest reciprocal tariffs are mostly lower than those he announced on \u201cliberation day\u201d on April 2, they raise the US\u2019s effective tariff to its highest level in decades. Switzerland\u2019s eleventh-hour bid to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs leaves the Alpine nation \u2014 an exporter of pharmaceuticals, precious metals and watches \u2014 with atariff of 39 per cent, one of the highest among developed nations. Keller-Sutter met US secretary of state Marco Rubio during her trip to Washington this week, but not US trade representative Jamieson Greer or commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who have both led US trade talks. Switzerland had initially expected to secure a minimal 10 per cent tariff from the US, in line with the lowest level on offer to other countries. A US official said Trump\u2019s negotiators had not agreed to that. In a post on X, Keller-Sutter said she had discussed \u201cbilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the tariff situation and international issues\u201d with Rubio. Trump\u2019s secretary of state has not typically been involved in Washington\u2019s negotiations with trading partners. US trading partners are now bracing themselves for enforcement of the new regime, while unsure if the president is open to negotiating deals to soften the levies. Trump has hailed his tariffs for \u201ctaking in trillions of dollars\u201d for America, and has boasted that his trade deals are making the US \u201ca rich country again\u201d. Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research group, this week said that the US had collected about $30bn in customs and excise duties in July, up from about $8bn a month on average in 2024. Some goods will still be allowed to enter the US without triggering the higher rate of tariff. According to a Customs and Border Protection notice published earlier this week, goods cleared through US customs from 12.01am on Thursday will be subject to the higher tariffs. Recommended However, the notice says goods already en route to the US before 12.01am eastern time on Thursday and that arrive by October 5 will not be subject to the new rates. Lynn Fischer Fox, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter and former US trade official, said the rules meant that goods arriving by plane, truck or train on or after August 7 would be subject to the higher duties. They could include air freight leaving Switzerland on August 7 and arriving in the US on the same day, she said. Lawyers said goods being shipped from further afield, such as Asia, may be able to pay lower rates until October 5, provided they were on the final leg of their journey before August 7.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f642686-d9bf-4d16-a2f6-2d2ab8fb43d2", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:24:55.008915", "sentiment_score": -0.125900000333786, "symbol": "ARE"}

Dojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources. The disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their ownAI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo headGanesh Venkataramananand ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has pushedto get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. Tesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d\u00a0He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up toTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal,which happened in October. But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021.Venkataramananpresented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a$16.5 billion deal with Samsungto make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said. The news comes asTesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay packageto keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "High costs and thin margins threatening AI coding startups", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead,\u00a0news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation:$3 billion. While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it. This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person. But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said. In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance. Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market. Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. \u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another. Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having alreadyturned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI. And Anysphereannounced in Januarythat it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.In July, the startuphired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Codeteam, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employeesreturnedto work at Anthropic. In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, thecost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance,OpenAI introduceda new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphereimmediately offeredthis model as a choice for Cursor users. Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some ofCursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in ablog post. This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached$500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say. Anysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a$2.4 billion payoutto key shareholders. The remaining business thensold itself to Cognition. While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well. Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "SpaceX is building a water pipeline to Starbase \u2014 but access comes with some conditions", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn\u2019t a launch mount or a booster. It\u2019s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of \u201ccompany town.\u201d The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city. \u201cUnder a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend \u2014 at their cost \u2014 a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX\u2019s construction schedule.\u201d The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service,according to the San Antonio Express-News.Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase\u2019s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff \u201cposes safety and public health risks.\u201d Starbase \u201chas neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,\u201d Myers said. Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an \u201cunconditional and perpetual agreement\u201d to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase\u2019s water and sewer system for residents\u2019 agreement to leave the area for \u201cany and all launch, testing and other operational activities.\u201d The document also states that \u201cSpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX\u2019s water and wastewater treatment,\u201d nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking \u201clegal or monetary recourse\u201d against the company. The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX\u2019s sprawling South Texas launch site. The city was incorporated in May. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units. Starbase\u2019s role is limited by design: \u201cThe City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,\u201d Myers told TechCrunch. \u201cThese services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.\u201d In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don\u2019t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX\u2019s discretion, and on SpaceX\u2019s terms. The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn\u2019t create a public right to water. According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services.

Duolingo stock rosealmost 30%on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahnsharedthat Duolingo would become an \u201cAI-first\u201d company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. \u201cWithout AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,\u201d von Ahn wrote at the time. \u201cWe owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\u201d While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company\u2019s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the companyanticipatesmaking over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company\u2019s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn\u2019t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,\u201d von Ahn said. \u201cThe most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.\u201d On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo\u2019s videos often remain criticisms of the company\u2019s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, \u201cNope. Made by our great team!\u201d But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not\u00a0\u2026 and from the company\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what matters.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "AI agents aren\u2019t the \u2018new Google,\u2019 says Airbnb CEO", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After a second-quarter earningsbeat, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared his thoughts on the company\u2019s AI strategy, cautioning investors that AI chatbots can\u2019t yet be thought of as the \u201cnew Google.\u201d That is, AI chatbots, while potentially driving new leads to the travel and services business, aren\u2019t entirely a replacement for the referrals that the dominant search engine brings. At least not at this time. \u201cI think we\u2019re still kind of feeling out the space,\u201d the exec told investors on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cThe thing I want to caution is I don\u2019t think that AI agents \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of chatbots like Google \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should think of them as the \u2018new Google\u2019 yet.\u201d This, Chesky explained, is because AI models aren\u2019t \u201cproprietary.\u201d \u201cWe also have to remember that the model powering ChatGPT is not proprietary. It\u2019s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We \u2014 Airbnb \u2014 can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,\u201d he said. Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve noticed is it\u2019s not enough to just have\u00a0\u2026 the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can\u2019t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times. Airbnb\u2019s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips. Plus, AI will come to Airbnb\u2019s search next year, the CEO said. However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it\u2019s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking. Because of this, Chesky doesn\u2019t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as \u201cpotentially interesting lead generation\u201d for the company. \u201cI think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly open to,\u201d he said. Airbnb beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stockdroppedon its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "How Tim Cook convinced Trump to drop made-in-USA iPhone \u2014 for now", "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with President Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S.But a closer look at Apple's announcements suggest that what Cook disclosed was an update to its U.S. strategy, not a major break.Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trumphas made clear that he wantsAppleto make iPhones in the U.S.Apple CEOTim Cookis doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.Cook on Wednesdayappearedat the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce themade-in-USA iPhonethat Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.Trump appeared happy enough, for now.\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that woulddouble their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\" The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.For example, Applesaidthat all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made byCorning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up witha $250 millioncommitment in 2019, and $45million in 2021.Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership withTexas Instrumentsto make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are withApplied Materials, a tooling company,GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplyingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.GlobalFoundries manufactures chips forBroadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plantin 2022and committed to buying chips from the factory.Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an ArizonaAmkorfacility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"Trump had a different take.\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments. Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers arecontractually requiredto keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Applesaidin February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate ofabout $70 billion per year. In February, the companycommittedto $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previouslypredicteda made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\" Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRONvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of earningsA bearish 'double top' pattern just formed in the Dow.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "China's July factory-gate prices miss forecast, deflation concerns persist", "content": "China's producer prices fell more than expected in July, while consumer prices were unchanged, underscoring the impact of sluggish domestic demand and persistent trade uncertainty on consumer and business sentiment.Factory-gate prices have been declining for more than two years, and Saturday's data suggest early-stage efforts to tackle price competition have yet to yield significant results.Deflationary pressures have prompted Chinese authorities to address overcapacity in key industries. However, the latest round of\u00a0industrial restructuring\u00a0appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.The producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.Extreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.However, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.Despite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.He expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.Still, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.China's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.Extreme weather added to the economic strain, with swelteringheatgripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usualdownpourslashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"The property sector has not stabilized. The economy is still supported more by external demand than domestic consumption.

Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"His comments came after Trump announced onTruth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhad been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \"swapping\" territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\"More from NBC News:Trump says ceasefire talks with Putin set for next week in AlaskaWith Zelenskyy sidelined, Trump appears to hand Putin a winRussia claims capture of key Ukrainian stronghold and hits KyivA White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \"decisions against peace,\" adding, \"They will not achieve anything.\"The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday.Russia's demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in each region.It remains unclear whether Trump's reference to \"swapping\" territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side's control.Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \"security guarantees\" from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe sinceWorld War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.In Trump's first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \"got along great\" with him.But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war.Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday.\"The underlying issues have not changed,\" he said. \"For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\" He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \"another step\" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.On the ground, the Kremlin's larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region's prosecutor's office said Saturday.Ukraine's Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/trump-zelenskyy-rejects-ukraine-russia-territory-swap-proposal.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:46:38.134752", "sentiment_score": -0.13220000267028809, "symbol": "COST"}

Both gold spot and futures fell after the initial surge, when a White House official told Bloomberg that the President would introduce a policy clarifying that imports of gold bars should not be subject to tariffs. That didn't stop gold-backed tokens from being minted, however. The warning also saw gold-based cryptocurrencies, including Tether GoldXAUT$3,383.35and Paxos Gold(PAXG), briefly top $3,390 before receding. Minting volumes, perRWA.xyzdata, reached $439 million over the week, more than doubling the previous $195 million record seen in 2021. These tokens, which are backed by physical reserves held in vaults, allow investors to gain exposure to the precious metal and can be transferred instantly on-chain without crossing borders. Switzerland, which refines a large share of the world\u2019s gold despite having no mines of its own, exportedmore than $61 billionworth of the metal to the U.S. over the past year. The move has triggered a political backlash in Switzerland, with some lawmakers calling for the gold sector to shoulder part of the economic fallout. The precious metal makes up over a quarter of Switzerland\u2019s exports, perSwiss National Bank data. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

A lot of Ukrainians have died,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d But on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the possibility of ceding parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Russian forces did not control. \u201cUkrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address\u00a0on Telegram. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the Constitution in Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Zelenskyy also warned that any meeting between Trump and Putin that sidestepped Kyiv risked undermining Kyiv\u2019s long-standing diplomatic principle of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d. \u201cAny decisions that are against us, any decisions that are against Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cIn the coming days, Moscow and Washington will devote themselves to the intensive development of the practical and political parameters of the summit in Alaska.\u201d This will be a \u201cchallenging process\u201d, he added. Western and Ukrainian officials suggested the discussion of territorial concessions echoed plans Putin presented in a meeting in Moscow last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump says talks are under way for \u2018swapping of territories\u2019 in the Ukraine-Russia war Trump briefed European leaders on Witkoff\u2019s meeting in a call on Wednesday, which was joined by Zelenskyy. Senior Ukrainian officials involved in calls with the US and European allies said Putin had floated the plan for Ukraine to cede large swaths of its territory during the three-hour meeting with Witkoff. Another western official said there had been extensive discussions of land swaps. Putin\u2019s proposals had veered little from the maximalist claims to Ukraine he had laid out in 2022, the Ukrainian officials said. Russia\u2019s leader proposed freezing the front line in south-eastern Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including territory not currently controlled by Moscow\u2019s forces, the officials said. Russia controls almost all of Luhansk region and a huge swatch of Donetsk region, but has struggled to capture critical Ukrainian strongholds in the latter despite its summer offensive. The southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where Russian forces have been stuck on the south-eastern side of the Dnipro river would be up for discussion, as would small areas of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions controlled by the Russian military. Moscow could withdraw forces from those regions. A recent Gallup poll suggested that Ukrainians\u2019 support for fighting until victory has hit a new low, with 69 per cent favouring a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible \u2014 a nearly complete reversal from public opinion in 2022. But polls also suggest most Ukrainians are not prepared to formally concede territory in exchange for peace. Putin also demanded Nato membership for Ukraine be taken off the table, although EU membership would still be allowed, the officials said. Ukraine\u2019s military would be limited in size, and Russia would demand western allies not provide Kyiv with long-range weapons. Renouncing Nato membership would be resisted by Ukraine and its European allies, officials said. \u201cIt looks like Munich 1938, when great powers decide the fate of the victim of the aggression,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Ukrainian parliament and an MP in Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party. He called what Putin was offering to end the war \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and said agreement by Zelenskyy \u201cmight cause a social explosion in Ukraine\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments that land could be exchanged came ahead of a planned meeting in the UK involving British foreign secretary David Lammy and US vice-president JD Vance to discuss Ukraine. One person familiar with the matter said Witkoff could attend the meeting at Lammy\u2019s official residence in southern England. Another said Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, could also attend. Trump kicked off a new round of diplomacy last month when he expressed anger with Russia\u2019s continued attacks on Ukraine and gave Putin a 10-day deadline to agree a ceasefire or face US economic penalties. Recommended The Financial Times previously reported that Trump could hit Moscow\u2019s shadow fleet of oil tankers withsanctionsto staunch a stream of petrodollars to Putin\u2019s war chest. The US has also threatened to target importers of Russian oil. Friday marked the passing of Trump\u2019s deadline \u2014 although he said he believed Putin and Zelenskyy were still eager to secure an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

People close to the Ukrainian president told the Financial Times that he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s decision to hold a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week without inviting Ukraine to participate. The prospect of Trump and Putin discussing the war behind closed doors, without Ukrainian representation, has raised deep concerns in Kyiv that the future of Ukraine could be negotiated over its head. On Saturday Zelenskyy was attempting to build a unified position with European leaders to firm up international opposition to any backroom deal that could compromise Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, according to senior officials close to the president. His efforts come as officials from the US, Europe and Ukraine prepare to meet in the UK on Saturday. Zelenskyy has dispatched Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine\u2019s secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, to the talks, which US Vice-President JD Vance will attend. Umerov has led Kyiv\u2019s delegation in each of the three rounds of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul since March. Zelenskyy and his advisers are trying to persuade Trump and his team to adopt what one official called a more \u201crational\u201d approach to Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. There is particular anxiety that Trump could seek a quick resolution to the war by offering Putin territorial concessions, legitimising its illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of huge parts of four mainland regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. On Saturday Ukrainian officials were adamant that the US president did not have the legal or political power to order Ukraine to hand over land. Even if Trump wanted to cut a deal, \u201cnobody here in Ukraine has a legal way to give up territories\u201d, an the official added. In an address the nation on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that a peace deal with Russia could involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d, insisting that Ukrainians \u201cwill not gift their land to the occupier\u201d. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the constitution in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Trump announced on Friday that he would meetPutinin Alaska on August 15, adding that a peace deal would probably involve Kyiv ceding territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both,\u201d Trump said. That idea was dismissed in Kyiv. \u201cUkraine will not accept any agreement made without it, especially one that legitimises Russia\u2019s occupation of its sovereign territory,\u201d said another Ukrainian official. Any such deal would have to be ratified by parliament, officials in Kyiv said. Numerous\u00a0Ukrainian MPs including many from Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party have told the Financial Times that they would not vote on legislation that would see parts of Ukraine handed over to Russia as part of a deal to end the war. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s summit, which will be hosted by UK foreign secretary David Lammy at his country residence outside London, Zelenskyy held calls with several European leaders. Downing Street said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy \u201cagreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war\u201d. Zelenskyy said of his call with Starmer that \u201cwe share the same view on the need for a truly lasting peace for Ukraine and on the danger of Russia\u2019s plan to reduce everything to discussing the impossible\u201d. Following a call with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe see no changes in Russia\u2019s position \u2014 the Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war and still push the idea of \u2018exchanging\u2019 Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favourable positions for Russia to resume the war.\u201d At the summit, European capitals will seek to clarify \u201chow determined\u201d the US administration is in sealing a deal with Putin and whether it is conscious of the implications of any territorial concessions to Russia, one European government official told the FT. Conflicting\u00a0scenarios have been set out by different parts of the Trump administration, with differences between what secretary of state Marco Rubio, US special Envoy Steve Witkoff and even Trump himself had conveyed, the person said. Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that the Russian proposal included a freezing of the frontline in south-eastern Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to pull back from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that it still controlled. Moscow has previously laid claim to the entire Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions despite the two regional capitals remaining under Ukrainian control. Swaths of land controlled by Russian forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions may be up for discussion, the officials said. Leaders in the Baltic states criticised any push to force Ukraine into ceding territory amid worries that the region could be a target for Putin. \u201cIf borders can be changed by force, none are safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the cornerstones of global stability. We will not reward aggression \u2014 not in Ukraine, not anywhere,\u201d Margus Tsahkna, Estonia\u2019s foreign minister, said. Recommended Baiba Bra\u017ee, Latvia\u2019s foreign minister, said: \u201cJust, lasting, dignified peace is what we all want, Ukrainians the most. Such peace must involve Ukraine and uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Ukraine has spent the past few years fortifying big cities in the Donetsk region that Moscow is reportedly demanding Kyiv give up. More than 120,000 people still live in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the two main cities in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk. \u201cIf Ukraine cedes territory without concessions or enforceable guarantees, Russia would then seize fortified defensive lines at no cost,\u201d a former Ukrainian officer who runs analytical group Frontelligence Insight wrote on X. \u201cFrom that position Moscow will renew hostilities with impunity.\u201d Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo, Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Berlin, Anna Gross in London and James Politi in Washington", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/69ab6ad3-826e-4bda-a512-250992d09cae", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:12.434396", "sentiment_score": -0.5577999949455261, "symbol": "TGT"}

On Thursday, the Customs and Border Protection agency had published a ruling, which was first reported by the Financial Times, saying one-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars should beclassified with a customs codethat is subject to tariffs. Its decision stood in sharp contrast to a previous White House statement in April that bullion would be exempt from Trump\u2019s levies. Gold for December delivery dropped by 1 per cent to $3,460 per troy ounce on Friday after the FT reported on the White House\u2019s plan to clarify its tariff.

The London Bullion Market Association, which represents large institutional gold traders and banks, said on Friday evening that it was \u201cseeking clarification\u201d from US authorities. The US Comex is the world\u2019s largest financial market for bullion, but to function efficiently the market relies on having unfettered access to the physicalgoldmarket centred on London \u2014 which would be threatened by any levies, according to market participants. Many in the gold industry have questioned whether the CBP ruling, which was written in response to an inquiry from a Swiss refiner, could have been a bureaucratic mistake. \u201cThe US has to decide if the White House was wrong in April, or if the CBP is wrong now,\u201d said one executive. Switzerland was dealt a particularly heavy blow as a result of the US\u2019s tariffs decision, since the country is the world\u2019s largest refining hub. The tariff ruling would \u201cnegatively impact\u201d the flow of physical gold around the world, noted the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders in Precious Metals Association in astatementon Friday. Trump reignited his global trade war earlier this week by reimposing his reciprocaltariffson almost every US trading partner, pushing American import duties to their highest level in decades. But the US president has also offered a host of exemptions to the levies, including to products such as pharmaceuticals or chips, that the US may apply separate tariffs to in future. In April, the US issued further exemptions to a range of consumer electronics such as laptops, smartphones and earphones. Trump has also signalled he may be willing to offer carve-outs for companies such as Apple that promise to make big investments in the US.

The abrupt removal of the chief of the US government\u2019s tax collection and enforcement agency on Friday caps a period of extraordinary turmoil and turnover at theIRS. Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January there have been four acting commissioners at the IRS prior to the start of Long\u2019s tenure in June. Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, will now become acting commissioner of the IRS. The Treasury department oversees the tax agency so Long was already reporting to Bessent prior to his removal. Long said in a post on X on Friday that he had been tapped to be US ambassador to Iceland: \u201cIt is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\u201d The New York Times first reportedTrumpwas planning to remove Long, who was a former auctioneer, property agent and member of Congress before he took up the post at the IRS. The White House and Treasury did not explain why the president wanted him out of the tax service. A Treasury spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cHis zeal and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to the Federal Government was evident in both the House of Representatives and as part of the Trump Administration. A new candidate for Commissioner will be announced at the appropriate time.\u201d The IRS has shed about a quarter of its workforce since Trump\u2019s second term began as the White House moved rapidly to slash the size of government agencies. The dismissals of IRS staff this year stands in contrast to a boost in funding that former president Joe Biden enacted during his time in office in order to increase the agency\u2019s capacity to audit wealthy taxpayers. Long had recently placed two top IRS officials on administrative leave, said one person familiar with the matter. The New York Times on Thursday reported that Long sent an email to staff telling them they could leave work early on Friday. \u201cPlease enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow.

Rachel Reeves plans to link tax rises in the Budget with a promise of improved living conditions in the longer term, as the chancellor and her team begin drawing up a list of which measures she may tighten in the autumn. The chancellor is keen to try and soften the blow of any revenue raising measures on households, according to people close to her, but economists predict she may need to make drastic changes to fill a hole of around \u00a340bn in the public finances. \u201cThe budget is a moment, but she wants to make sure there\u2019s a bigger economic agenda pushing through,\u201d said one person close to the chancellor. The narrative around improving equity and fairness for working people is seen as key to fending off the threat posed by Nigel Farage, who has attracted former Labour voters with a simple message about economic and national decline, which he has tied to high levels of migration. People close to Reeves said she plans to drip feed announcements in the autumn, including finalising the Northern Powerhouse rail project and introducing fresh legislation to speed up planning for infrastructure projects such as data centres, that speak to the government\u2019s wider goal of improving productivity. Reeves sat down with Sir Keir Starmer this past week to go through which taxes to increase, a task made harder by the pledge not to increase income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. Treasury officials insist the three will not be touched in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge. Reeves is also working through a pile of proposals from Treasury officials for tax increases that economists believe could include measures such as freezing tax bands, raising duties on unhealthy foods and gambling, and even potentially increasing fuel duty. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said if the black hole was only \u00a320-\u00a325bn, this would allow the Treasury to \u201cmake some pretty sensible changes\u201d that would not inflict too much damage on the economy and could fit into a marketable centre-left story. Those measures could include prolonging a freeze on income tax band thresholds \u2014 a measure derided last year as \u201cunfair\u201d by Reeves \u2014 to increase receipts by around \u00a34bn a year, and moves such as increasing duties on unhealthy foods to tackle the obesity crisis. But Smith said if the black hole exceeded \u00a340bn, as many economists fear, the government would need to look at more drastic measures. \u201cThe big political call is whether to break one of the manifesto pledges,\u201d Smith said. Last year, ahead of the election, senior Labour figures were set on ruling out increases to National Insurance and income tax, but wavered for 24 hours before ruling out increases to VAT, according to officials. The UK deploys sales taxes more narrowly than many comparable countries. Broadening the scope of the tax rather than raising it may allow Reeves to claim the pledge is intact. Taxes on the gambling industry look almost certain to increase at the budget, a proposal championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown this week, who wants the \u00a33bn increase on duties paid by online betting groups to fund removing the contentious two-child benefit cap. But many other taxes are in play. Downing Street is keeping an open mind given uncertainty about the scale of the challenge the UK faces in balancing the national books. Starmer has laid down no red lines outside the manifesto pledge, leaving taxes such as fuel duty \u2014 normally seen as politically toxic \u2014 as an option, economists say. Increasing fuel duty would align with the wider Labour narrative about investing in net zero and electrification, though the level has been frozen for more than a decade. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour was \u201cgearing up to punish the British public with more tax rises\u201d. People close to the PM insist the plan for the autumn is not a \u201creset\u201d despite Labour enduring a difficult first year in office, which has left it trailing Reform UK in the polls. Starmer remains focused on boosting the economy, they say, and is desperate to accelerate progress in areas like planning reform. Mujtaba Rahman at Eurasia Group questioned, however, whether voters would really think that a message of \u201cfairness\u201d would sweeten the sour note of higher taxes enough. \u201cAt times this feels like a government in search of a narrative.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/297b01f4-e629-4811-8726-aed9dceea334", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T15:47:16.860632", "sentiment_score": 0.20839999616146088, "symbol": "ARE"}

But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT RedditcomplainedGPT-5 wasn\u2019t working as well for them as 4o did.\u00a0Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed \u201cdumber\u201d was the router wasn\u2019t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday. \u201cGPT-5 will seem smarter starting today.

Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote. And Altman also promised, \u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.\u201d\u00a0This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts. Predictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many\u201cchart crime\u201d jokes. The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar. Altman didn\u2019t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a \u201cmega chart screwup\u201don X. Others noted the charts in thepublished blog post were correct. But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation.

Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous postson social mediaurging users to turn off location sharing,incorrectly claimingthat it\u2019s automatically turned on. \u201cWe\u2019re double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\u201d Mosseri said in aThreads post. \u201cWe\u2019re still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\u201d Mosseri also said that somepeople are \u201cconfused\u201dabout how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. It\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you\u2019re still at the location). If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn\u2019t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps below. To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new \u201cMap\u201d option at the top. If it\u2019s your first time accessing the feature, you\u2019ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads \u201cWho can see your location.\u201d From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the \u201cStory, live and location\u201d option, and then tap the \u201cLocation sharing\u201d button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you\u2019ll be able to see them on the Map. When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you\u2019ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or \u201cNotes,\u201d on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they\u2019re shared with a location.

Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, likea shark wearing sneakersanda ballerina with a cappuccino for a head. One startup driving this trend isOpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users. The company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising. With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden. Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion. The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy. While these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation. During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June,Disney and Universalsued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder. \u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters. One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent. \u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said. Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app. OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member. OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey \u2014 around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases. Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users\u2019 interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. \u201cI think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything\u00a0\u2026\u201d Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,\u201d he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn\u2019t talk about it that way, usually, because it\u2019s not how users think of it. \u201cBut when users say things like \u2018Pinterest just gets me,\u2019 it\u2019s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they\u2019re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,\u201d he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a \u201cCambrian moment,\u201d and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch anew set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention ofmass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn\u2019t say if that\u2019s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including onFacebook,Instagram, andTumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that\u2019s used for good and used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d \u201cOn the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cBoth in terms of what we\u2019re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what\u2019s happening in the rest of social media,\u201d he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected.

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle. The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment.

Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May,Bloomberg reportedthat SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy.

Some of the steepest duties include Syria's 41% and Laos' and Myanmar's 40% rate.Trumpwarned U.S. courts Friday against striking downhis tariff policy, writing in a Truth Social post that if the courts were to do that, \"It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION.\" He also said that the duties have been having a \"huge positive impact\" on the market. Stocks nosedived in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff announcement back in April, with the S&P 500falling into correction territoryafter seeing its biggest single-day loss since 2020.\"The market's reaction to the April 2 announcement kind of shows how markets feel about tariffs,\" Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategist, said. \"Investors are largely anticipating the administration not following through on hyper aggressive tariff plans, so it's kind of like chicken-and-egg, and I think we're still kind of in the later stages of figuring that out.\"\"If markets anticipate that but don't react because they're waiting for the capitulation, the administration could possibly take it that the market is enforcing the policy rather than anticipating a change, so it is kind of a tricky dynamic,\" he continued.  20 Hours Ago The three leading U.S. indexes moved higher Friday, adding to the week's strong performance.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 206.97 points, or 0.47%, to settle at 44,175.61.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "How Tim Cook convinced Trump to drop made-in-USA iPhone \u2014 for now", "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with President Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S.But a closer look at Apple's announcements suggest that what Cook disclosed was an update to its U.S. strategy, not a major break.Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trumphas made clear that he wantsAppleto make iPhones in the U.S.Apple CEOTim Cookis doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.Cook on Wednesdayappearedat the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce themade-in-USA iPhonethat Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.Trump appeared happy enough, for now.\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that woulddouble their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\" The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.For example, Applesaidthat all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made byCorning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up witha $250 millioncommitment in 2019, and $45million in 2021.Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership withTexas Instrumentsto make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are withApplied Materials, a tooling company,GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplyingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.GlobalFoundries manufactures chips forBroadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plantin 2022and committed to buying chips from the factory.Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an ArizonaAmkorfacility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"Trump had a different take.\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments. Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers arecontractually requiredto keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Applesaidin February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate ofabout $70 billion per year. In February, the companycommittedto $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previouslypredicteda made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\" Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRONvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of earningsA bearish 'double top' pattern just formed in the Dow.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "China's July factory-gate prices miss forecast, deflation concerns persist", "content": "China's producer prices fell more than expected in July, while consumer prices were unchanged, underscoring the impact of sluggish domestic demand and persistent trade uncertainty on consumer and business sentiment.Factory-gate prices have been declining for more than two years, and Saturday's data suggest early-stage efforts to tackle price competition have yet to yield significant results.Deflationary pressures have prompted Chinese authorities to address overcapacity in key industries. However, the latest round of\u00a0industrial restructuring\u00a0appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.The producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.Extreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.However, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.Despite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.He expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.Still, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.China's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.Extreme weather added to the economic strain, with swelteringheatgripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usualdownpourslashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"The property sector has not stabilized. The economy is still supported more by external demand than domestic consumption.

Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"His comments came after Trump announced onTruth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhad been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \"swapping\" territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\"More from NBC News:Trump says ceasefire talks with Putin set for next week in AlaskaWith Zelenskyy sidelined, Trump appears to hand Putin a winRussia claims capture of key Ukrainian stronghold and hits KyivA White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \"decisions against peace,\" adding, \"They will not achieve anything.\"The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday.Russia's demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in each region.It remains unclear whether Trump's reference to \"swapping\" territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side's control.Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \"security guarantees\" from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe sinceWorld War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.In Trump's first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \"got along great\" with him.But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war.Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday.\"The underlying issues have not changed,\" he said. \"For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\" He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \"another step\" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.On the ground, the Kremlin's larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region's prosecutor's office said Saturday.Ukraine's Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/trump-zelenskyy-rejects-ukraine-russia-territory-swap-proposal.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:40:54.475021", "sentiment_score": -0.13220000267028809, "symbol": "COST"}

The warning also saw gold-based cryptocurrencies, including Tether GoldXAUT$3,383.35and Paxos Gold(PAXG), briefly top $3,390 before receding. Minting volumes, perRWA.xyzdata, reached $439 million over the week, more than doubling the previous $195 million record seen in 2021. These tokens, which are backed by physical reserves held in vaults, allow investors to gain exposure to the precious metal and can be transferred instantly on-chain without crossing borders. Switzerland, which refines a large share of the world\u2019s gold despite having no mines of its own, exportedmore than $61 billionworth of the metal to the U.S. over the past year. The move has triggered a political backlash in Switzerland, with some lawmakers calling for the gold sector to shoulder part of the economic fallout.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Zelenskyy looks to European allies to stop handover of territory to Russia", "content": " Christopher Millerin New York andFabrice Deprezin Kyiv PublishedAugust 9 2025 UpdatedAugust 9 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Volodymyr Zelenskyy is trying to shore up European opposition to any loss of Ukrainian land to Russia after Donald Trump said that a peace deal might involve \u201csome swapping of territory\u201d. People close to the Ukrainian president told the Financial Times that he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s decision to hold a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week without inviting Ukraine to participate. The prospect of Trump and Putin discussing the war behind closed doors, without Ukrainian representation, has raised deep concerns in Kyiv that the future of Ukraine could be negotiated over its head. On Saturday Zelenskyy was attempting to build a unified position with European leaders to firm up international opposition to any backroom deal that could compromise Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, according to senior officials close to the president. His efforts come as officials from the US, Europe and Ukraine prepare to meet in the UK on Saturday. Zelenskyy has dispatched Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine\u2019s secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, to the talks, which US Vice-President JD Vance will attend. Umerov has led Kyiv\u2019s delegation in each of the three rounds of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul since March. Zelenskyy and his advisers are trying to persuade Trump and his team to adopt what one official called a more \u201crational\u201d approach to Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. There is particular anxiety that Trump could seek a quick resolution to the war by offering Putin territorial concessions, legitimising its illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of huge parts of four mainland regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. On Saturday Ukrainian officials were adamant that the US president did not have the legal or political power to order Ukraine to hand over land. Even if Trump wanted to cut a deal, \u201cnobody here in Ukraine has a legal way to give up territories\u201d, an the official added. In an address the nation on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that a peace deal with Russia could involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d, insisting that Ukrainians \u201cwill not gift their land to the occupier\u201d. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the constitution in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Trump announced on Friday that he would meetPutinin Alaska on August 15, adding that a peace deal would probably involve Kyiv ceding territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both,\u201d Trump said. That idea was dismissed in Kyiv. \u201cUkraine will not accept any agreement made without it, especially one that legitimises Russia\u2019s occupation of its sovereign territory,\u201d said another Ukrainian official. Any such deal would have to be ratified by parliament, officials in Kyiv said. Numerous\u00a0Ukrainian MPs including many from Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party have told the Financial Times that they would not vote on legislation that would see parts of Ukraine handed over to Russia as part of a deal to end the war. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s summit, which will be hosted by UK foreign secretary David Lammy at his country residence outside London, Zelenskyy held calls with several European leaders. Downing Street said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy \u201cagreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war\u201d. Zelenskyy said of his call with Starmer that \u201cwe share the same view on the need for a truly lasting peace for Ukraine and on the danger of Russia\u2019s plan to reduce everything to discussing the impossible\u201d. Following a call with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe see no changes in Russia\u2019s position \u2014 the Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war and still push the idea of \u2018exchanging\u2019 Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favourable positions for Russia to resume the war.\u201d At the summit, European capitals will seek to clarify \u201chow determined\u201d the US administration is in sealing a deal with Putin and whether it is conscious of the implications of any territorial concessions to Russia, one European government official told the FT. Conflicting\u00a0scenarios have been set out by different parts of the Trump administration, with differences between what secretary of state Marco Rubio, US special Envoy Steve Witkoff and even Trump himself had conveyed, the person said. Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that the Russian proposal included a freezing of the frontline in south-eastern Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to pull back from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that it still controlled. Moscow has previously laid claim to the entire Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions despite the two regional capitals remaining under Ukrainian control. Swaths of land controlled by Russian forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions may be up for discussion, the officials said. Leaders in the Baltic states criticised any push to force Ukraine into ceding territory amid worries that the region could be a target for Putin. \u201cIf borders can be changed by force, none are safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the cornerstones of global stability. We will not reward aggression \u2014 not in Ukraine, not anywhere,\u201d Margus Tsahkna, Estonia\u2019s foreign minister, said.

A lot of Ukrainians have died,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d But on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the possibility of ceding parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Russian forces did not control. \u201cUkrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address\u00a0on Telegram. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the Constitution in Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Zelenskyy also warned that any meeting between Trump and Putin that sidestepped Kyiv risked undermining Kyiv\u2019s long-standing diplomatic principle of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d. \u201cAny decisions that are against us, any decisions that are against Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cIn the coming days, Moscow and Washington will devote themselves to the intensive development of the practical and political parameters of the summit in Alaska.\u201d This will be a \u201cchallenging process\u201d, he added. Western and Ukrainian officials suggested the discussion of territorial concessions echoed plans Putin presented in a meeting in Moscow last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump says talks are under way for \u2018swapping of territories\u2019 in the Ukraine-Russia war Trump briefed European leaders on Witkoff\u2019s meeting in a call on Wednesday, which was joined by Zelenskyy. Senior Ukrainian officials involved in calls with the US and European allies said Putin had floated the plan for Ukraine to cede large swaths of its territory during the three-hour meeting with Witkoff. Another western official said there had been extensive discussions of land swaps. Putin\u2019s proposals had veered little from the maximalist claims to Ukraine he had laid out in 2022, the Ukrainian officials said. Russia\u2019s leader proposed freezing the front line in south-eastern Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including territory not currently controlled by Moscow\u2019s forces, the officials said. Russia controls almost all of Luhansk region and a huge swatch of Donetsk region, but has struggled to capture critical Ukrainian strongholds in the latter despite its summer offensive. The southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where Russian forces have been stuck on the south-eastern side of the Dnipro river would be up for discussion, as would small areas of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions controlled by the Russian military. Moscow could withdraw forces from those regions. A recent Gallup poll suggested that Ukrainians\u2019 support for fighting until victory has hit a new low, with 69 per cent favouring a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible \u2014 a nearly complete reversal from public opinion in 2022. But polls also suggest most Ukrainians are not prepared to formally concede territory in exchange for peace. Putin also demanded Nato membership for Ukraine be taken off the table, although EU membership would still be allowed, the officials said. Ukraine\u2019s military would be limited in size, and Russia would demand western allies not provide Kyiv with long-range weapons. Renouncing Nato membership would be resisted by Ukraine and its European allies, officials said. \u201cIt looks like Munich 1938, when great powers decide the fate of the victim of the aggression,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Ukrainian parliament and an MP in Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party. He called what Putin was offering to end the war \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and said agreement by Zelenskyy \u201cmight cause a social explosion in Ukraine\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments that land could be exchanged came ahead of a planned meeting in the UK involving British foreign secretary David Lammy and US vice-president JD Vance to discuss Ukraine. One person familiar with the matter said Witkoff could attend the meeting at Lammy\u2019s official residence in southern England. Another said Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, could also attend. Trump kicked off a new round of diplomacy last month when he expressed anger with Russia\u2019s continued attacks on Ukraine and gave Putin a 10-day deadline to agree a ceasefire or face US economic penalties. Recommended The Financial Times previously reported that Trump could hit Moscow\u2019s shadow fleet of oil tankers withsanctionsto staunch a stream of petrodollars to Putin\u2019s war chest. The US has also threatened to target importers of Russian oil. Friday marked the passing of Trump\u2019s deadline \u2014 although he said he believed Putin and Zelenskyy were still eager to secure an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

On Thursday, the Customs and Border Protection agency had published a ruling, which was first reported by the Financial Times, saying one-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars should beclassified with a customs codethat is subject to tariffs. Its decision stood in sharp contrast to a previous White House statement in April that bullion would be exempt from Trump\u2019s levies. Gold for December delivery dropped by 1 per cent to $3,460 per troy ounce on Friday after the FT reported on the White House\u2019s plan to clarify its tariff.

The US Comex is the world\u2019s largest financial market for bullion, but to function efficiently the market relies on having unfettered access to the physicalgoldmarket centred on London \u2014 which would be threatened by any levies, according to market participants. Many in the gold industry have questioned whether the CBP ruling, which was written in response to an inquiry from a Swiss refiner, could have been a bureaucratic mistake. \u201cThe US has to decide if the White House was wrong in April, or if the CBP is wrong now,\u201d said one executive. Switzerland was dealt a particularly heavy blow as a result of the US\u2019s tariffs decision, since the country is the world\u2019s largest refining hub.

Trump has also signalled he may be willing to offer carve-outs for companies such as Apple that promise to make big investments in the US.

The abrupt removal of the chief of the US government\u2019s tax collection and enforcement agency on Friday caps a period of extraordinary turmoil and turnover at theIRS. Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January there have been four acting commissioners at the IRS prior to the start of Long\u2019s tenure in June. Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, will now become acting commissioner of the IRS. The Treasury department oversees the tax agency so Long was already reporting to Bessent prior to his removal. Long said in a post on X on Friday that he had been tapped to be US ambassador to Iceland: \u201cIt is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\u201d The New York Times first reportedTrumpwas planning to remove Long, who was a former auctioneer, property agent and member of Congress before he took up the post at the IRS. The White House and Treasury did not explain why the president wanted him out of the tax service. A Treasury spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cHis zeal and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to the Federal Government was evident in both the House of Representatives and as part of the Trump Administration. A new candidate for Commissioner will be announced at the appropriate time.\u201d The IRS has shed about a quarter of its workforce since Trump\u2019s second term began as the White House moved rapidly to slash the size of government agencies. The dismissals of IRS staff this year stands in contrast to a boost in funding that former president Joe Biden enacted during his time in office in order to increase the agency\u2019s capacity to audit wealthy taxpayers. Long had recently placed two top IRS officials on administrative leave, said one person familiar with the matter. The New York Times on Thursday reported that Long sent an email to staff telling them they could leave work early on Friday. \u201cPlease enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Reeves hopes promise of fairness will cushion potential Budget tax rises", "content": " Anna GrossandDavid Sheppard PublishedAugust 8 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Rachel Reeves plans to link tax rises in the Budget with a promise of improved living conditions in the longer term, as the chancellor and her team begin drawing up a list of which measures she may tighten in the autumn. The chancellor is keen to try and soften the blow of any revenue raising measures on households, according to people close to her, but economists predict she may need to make drastic changes to fill a hole of around \u00a340bn in the public finances. \u201cThe budget is a moment, but she wants to make sure there\u2019s a bigger economic agenda pushing through,\u201d said one person close to the chancellor. The narrative around improving equity and fairness for working people is seen as key to fending off the threat posed by Nigel Farage, who has attracted former Labour voters with a simple message about economic and national decline, which he has tied to high levels of migration. People close to Reeves said she plans to drip feed announcements in the autumn, including finalising the Northern Powerhouse rail project and introducing fresh legislation to speed up planning for infrastructure projects such as data centres, that speak to the government\u2019s wider goal of improving productivity. Reeves sat down with Sir Keir Starmer this past week to go through which taxes to increase, a task made harder by the pledge not to increase income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. Treasury officials insist the three will not be touched in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge. Reeves is also working through a pile of proposals from Treasury officials for tax increases that economists believe could include measures such as freezing tax bands, raising duties on unhealthy foods and gambling, and even potentially increasing fuel duty. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said if the black hole was only \u00a320-\u00a325bn, this would allow the Treasury to \u201cmake some pretty sensible changes\u201d that would not inflict too much damage on the economy and could fit into a marketable centre-left story. Those measures could include prolonging a freeze on income tax band thresholds \u2014 a measure derided last year as \u201cunfair\u201d by Reeves \u2014 to increase receipts by around \u00a34bn a year, and moves such as increasing duties on unhealthy foods to tackle the obesity crisis. But Smith said if the black hole exceeded \u00a340bn, as many economists fear, the government would need to look at more drastic measures. \u201cThe big political call is whether to break one of the manifesto pledges,\u201d Smith said. Last year, ahead of the election, senior Labour figures were set on ruling out increases to National Insurance and income tax, but wavered for 24 hours before ruling out increases to VAT, according to officials. The UK deploys sales taxes more narrowly than many comparable countries. Broadening the scope of the tax rather than raising it may allow Reeves to claim the pledge is intact. Taxes on the gambling industry look almost certain to increase at the budget, a proposal championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown this week, who wants the \u00a33bn increase on duties paid by online betting groups to fund removing the contentious two-child benefit cap. But many other taxes are in play. Downing Street is keeping an open mind given uncertainty about the scale of the challenge the UK faces in balancing the national books. Starmer has laid down no red lines outside the manifesto pledge, leaving taxes such as fuel duty \u2014 normally seen as politically toxic \u2014 as an option, economists say. Increasing fuel duty would align with the wider Labour narrative about investing in net zero and electrification, though the level has been frozen for more than a decade. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour was \u201cgearing up to punish the British public with more tax rises\u201d. People close to the PM insist the plan for the autumn is not a \u201creset\u201d despite Labour enduring a difficult first year in office, which has left it trailing Reform UK in the polls. Starmer remains focused on boosting the economy, they say, and is desperate to accelerate progress in areas like planning reform. Mujtaba Rahman at Eurasia Group questioned, however, whether voters would really think that a message of \u201cfairness\u201d would sweeten the sour note of higher taxes enough. \u201cAt times this feels like a government in search of a narrative.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/297b01f4-e629-4811-8726-aed9dceea334", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:41:28.166588", "sentiment_score": 0.20839999616146088, "symbol": "ARE"}

Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote.

Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous postson social mediaurging users to turn off location sharing,incorrectly claimingthat it\u2019s automatically turned on. \u201cWe\u2019re double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\u201d Mosseri said in aThreads post. \u201cWe\u2019re still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\u201d Mosseri also said that somepeople are \u201cconfused\u201dabout how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. It\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you\u2019re still at the location). If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn\u2019t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps below. To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new \u201cMap\u201d option at the top. If it\u2019s your first time accessing the feature, you\u2019ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads \u201cWho can see your location.\u201d From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the \u201cStory, live and location\u201d option, and then tap the \u201cLocation sharing\u201d button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you\u2019ll be able to see them on the Map. When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you\u2019ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or \u201cNotes,\u201d on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they\u2019re shared with a location.

Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, likea shark wearing sneakersanda ballerina with a cappuccino for a head. One startup driving this trend isOpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users. The company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising. With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden. Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion. The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy. While these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation. During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June,Disney and Universalsued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder. \u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters. One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent. \u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said. Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app. OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member. OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey \u2014 around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases. Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users\u2019 interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. \u201cI think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything\u00a0\u2026\u201d Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,\u201d he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn\u2019t talk about it that way, usually, because it\u2019s not how users think of it. \u201cBut when users say things like \u2018Pinterest just gets me,\u2019 it\u2019s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they\u2019re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,\u201d he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a \u201cCambrian moment,\u201d and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch anew set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention ofmass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn\u2019t say if that\u2019s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including onFacebook,Instagram, andTumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that\u2019s used for good and used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d \u201cOn the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cBoth in terms of what we\u2019re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what\u2019s happening in the rest of social media,\u201d he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle. The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customerswent bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May,Bloomberg reportedthat SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy.

President Donald Trumphas made clear that he wantsAppleto make iPhones in the U.S.Apple CEOTim Cookis doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.Cook on Wednesdayappearedat the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce themade-in-USA iPhonethat Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.Trump appeared happy enough, for now.\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that woulddouble their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\" The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.For example, Applesaidthat all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made byCorning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up witha $250 millioncommitment in 2019, and $45million in 2021.Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership withTexas Instrumentsto make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are withApplied Materials, a tooling company,GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplyingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.GlobalFoundries manufactures chips forBroadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plantin 2022and committed to buying chips from the factory.Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an ArizonaAmkorfacility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"Trump had a different take.\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments. Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers arecontractually requiredto keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Applesaidin February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate ofabout $70 billion per year. In February, the companycommittedto $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previouslypredicteda made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\" Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRONvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of earningsA bearish 'double top' pattern just formed in the Dow.

{"source": "CNBC", "title": "China's July factory-gate prices miss forecast, deflation concerns persist", "content": "China's producer prices fell more than expected in July, while consumer prices were unchanged, underscoring the impact of sluggish domestic demand and persistent trade uncertainty on consumer and business sentiment.Factory-gate prices have been declining for more than two years, and Saturday's data suggest early-stage efforts to tackle price competition have yet to yield significant results.Deflationary pressures have prompted Chinese authorities to address overcapacity in key industries. However, the latest round of\u00a0industrial restructuring\u00a0appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.The producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.Extreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.However, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.Despite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.He expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.Still, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.China's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.Extreme weather added to the economic strain, with swelteringheatgripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usualdownpourslashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"The property sector has not stabilized. The economy is still supported more by external demand than domestic consumption.

Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"His comments came after Trump announced onTruth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhad been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian President in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \"swapping\" territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\"More from NBC News:Trump says ceasefire talks with Putin set for next week in AlaskaWith Zelenskyy sidelined, Trump appears to hand Putin a winRussia claims capture of key Ukrainian stronghold and hits KyivA White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were \"decisions against peace,\" adding, \"They will not achieve anything.\"The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday.Russia's demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in each region.It remains unclear whether Trump's reference to \"swapping\" territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side's control.Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \"security guarantees\" from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe sinceWorld War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.In Trump's first term, the president called Putin a strong and smart leader and said he \"got along great\" with him.But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war.Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday.\"The underlying issues have not changed,\" he said. \"For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\" He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \"another step\" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.On the ground, the Kremlin's larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region's prosecutor's office said Saturday.Ukraine's Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/trump-zelenskyy-rejects-ukraine-russia-territory-swap-proposal.html", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:49:30.507957", "sentiment_score": -0.13220000267028809, "symbol": "COST"}

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Zelenskyy looks to European allies to stop handover of territory to Russia", "content": " Christopher Millerin New York andFabrice Deprezin Kyiv PublishedAugust 9 2025 UpdatedAugust 9 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Volodymyr Zelenskyy is trying to shore up European opposition to any loss of Ukrainian land to Russia after Donald Trump said that a peace deal might involve \u201csome swapping of territory\u201d. People close to the Ukrainian president told the Financial Times that he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s decision to hold a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week without inviting Ukraine to participate. The prospect of Trump and Putin discussing the war behind closed doors, without Ukrainian representation, has raised deep concerns in Kyiv that the future of Ukraine could be negotiated over its head. On Saturday Zelenskyy was attempting to build a unified position with European leaders to firm up international opposition to any backroom deal that could compromise Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, according to senior officials close to the president. His efforts come as officials from the US, Europe and Ukraine prepare to meet in the UK on Saturday. Zelenskyy has dispatched Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine\u2019s secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, to the talks, which US Vice-President JD Vance will attend. Umerov has led Kyiv\u2019s delegation in each of the three rounds of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul since March. Zelenskyy and his advisers are trying to persuade Trump and his team to adopt what one official called a more \u201crational\u201d approach to Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. There is particular anxiety that Trump could seek a quick resolution to the war by offering Putin territorial concessions, legitimising its illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of huge parts of four mainland regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. On Saturday Ukrainian officials were adamant that the US president did not have the legal or political power to order Ukraine to hand over land. Even if Trump wanted to cut a deal, \u201cnobody here in Ukraine has a legal way to give up territories\u201d, an the official added. In an address the nation on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that a peace deal with Russia could involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d, insisting that Ukrainians \u201cwill not gift their land to the occupier\u201d. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the constitution in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Trump announced on Friday that he would meetPutinin Alaska on August 15, adding that a peace deal would probably involve Kyiv ceding territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both,\u201d Trump said. That idea was dismissed in Kyiv. \u201cUkraine will not accept any agreement made without it, especially one that legitimises Russia\u2019s occupation of its sovereign territory,\u201d said another Ukrainian official. Any such deal would have to be ratified by parliament, officials in Kyiv said. Numerous\u00a0Ukrainian MPs including many from Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party have told the Financial Times that they would not vote on legislation that would see parts of Ukraine handed over to Russia as part of a deal to end the war. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s summit, which will be hosted by UK foreign secretary David Lammy at his country residence outside London, Zelenskyy held calls with several European leaders. Downing Street said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy \u201cagreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war\u201d. Zelenskyy said of his call with Starmer that \u201cwe share the same view on the need for a truly lasting peace for Ukraine and on the danger of Russia\u2019s plan to reduce everything to discussing the impossible\u201d. Following a call with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe see no changes in Russia\u2019s position \u2014 the Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war and still push the idea of \u2018exchanging\u2019 Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favourable positions for Russia to resume the war.\u201d At the summit, European capitals will seek to clarify \u201chow determined\u201d the US administration is in sealing a deal with Putin and whether it is conscious of the implications of any territorial concessions to Russia, one European government official told the FT. Conflicting\u00a0scenarios have been set out by different parts of the Trump administration, with differences between what secretary of state Marco Rubio, US special Envoy Steve Witkoff and even Trump himself had conveyed, the person said. Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that the Russian proposal included a freezing of the frontline in south-eastern Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to pull back from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that it still controlled. Moscow has previously laid claim to the entire Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions despite the two regional capitals remaining under Ukrainian control. Swaths of land controlled by Russian forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions may be up for discussion, the officials said. Leaders in the Baltic states criticised any push to force Ukraine into ceding territory amid worries that the region could be a target for Putin. \u201cIf borders can be changed by force, none are safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the cornerstones of global stability. We will not reward aggression \u2014 not in Ukraine, not anywhere,\u201d Margus Tsahkna, Estonia\u2019s foreign minister, said. Recommended Baiba Bra\u017ee, Latvia\u2019s foreign minister, said: \u201cJust, lasting, dignified peace is what we all want, Ukrainians the most. Such peace must involve Ukraine and uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Ukraine has spent the past few years fortifying big cities in the Donetsk region that Moscow is reportedly demanding Kyiv give up. More than 120,000 people still live in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the two main cities in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk. \u201cIf Ukraine cedes territory without concessions or enforceable guarantees, Russia would then seize fortified defensive lines at no cost,\u201d a former Ukrainian officer who runs analytical group Frontelligence Insight wrote on X. \u201cFrom that position Moscow will renew hostilities with impunity.\u201d Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo, Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Berlin, Anna Gross in London and James Politi in Washington", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/69ab6ad3-826e-4bda-a512-250992d09cae", "timestamp": "2025-08-09T16:49:48.001573", "sentiment_score": -0.5577999949455261, "symbol": "TGT"}

A lot of Ukrainians have died,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d But on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the possibility of ceding parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Russian forces did not control. \u201cUkrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address\u00a0on Telegram. \u201cThe answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in the Constitution in Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to.\u201d Zelenskyy also warned that any meeting between Trump and Putin that sidestepped Kyiv risked undermining Kyiv\u2019s long-standing diplomatic principle of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d. \u201cAny decisions that are against us, any decisions that are against Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, said: \u201cIn the coming days, Moscow and Washington will devote themselves to the intensive development of the practical and political parameters of the summit in Alaska.\u201d This will be a \u201cchallenging process\u201d, he added. Western and Ukrainian officials suggested the discussion of territorial concessions echoed plans Putin presented in a meeting in Moscow last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump says talks are under way for \u2018swapping of territories\u2019 in the Ukraine-Russia war Trump briefed European leaders on Witkoff\u2019s meeting in a call on Wednesday, which was joined by Zelenskyy. Senior Ukrainian officials involved in calls with the US and European allies said Putin had floated the plan for Ukraine to cede large swaths of its territory during the three-hour meeting with Witkoff. Another western official said there had been extensive discussions of land swaps. Putin\u2019s proposals had veered little from the maximalist claims to Ukraine he had laid out in 2022, the Ukrainian officials said. Russia\u2019s leader proposed freezing the front line in south-eastern Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including territory not currently controlled by Moscow\u2019s forces, the officials said. Russia controls almost all of Luhansk region and a huge swatch of Donetsk region, but has struggled to capture critical Ukrainian strongholds in the latter despite its summer offensive. The southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where Russian forces have been stuck on the south-eastern side of the Dnipro river would be up for discussion, as would small areas of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions controlled by the Russian military. Moscow could withdraw forces from those regions. A recent Gallup poll suggested that Ukrainians\u2019 support for fighting until victory has hit a new low, with 69 per cent favouring a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible \u2014 a nearly complete reversal from public opinion in 2022. But polls also suggest most Ukrainians are not prepared to formally concede territory in exchange for peace. Putin also demanded Nato membership for Ukraine be taken off the table, although EU membership would still be allowed, the officials said. Ukraine\u2019s military would be limited in size, and Russia would demand western allies not provide Kyiv with long-range weapons. Renouncing Nato membership would be resisted by Ukraine and its European allies, officials said. \u201cIt looks like Munich 1938, when great powers decide the fate of the victim of the aggression,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Ukrainian parliament and an MP in Zelenskyy\u2019s ruling party. He called what Putin was offering to end the war \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and said agreement by Zelenskyy \u201cmight cause a social explosion in Ukraine\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments that land could be exchanged came ahead of a planned meeting in the UK involving British foreign secretary David Lammy and US vice-president JD Vance to discuss Ukraine. One person familiar with the matter said Witkoff could attend the meeting at Lammy\u2019s official residence in southern England. Another said Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, could also attend. Trump kicked off a new round of diplomacy last month when he expressed anger with Russia\u2019s continued attacks on Ukraine and gave Putin a 10-day deadline to agree a ceasefire or face US economic penalties. Recommended The Financial Times previously reported that Trump could hit Moscow\u2019s shadow fleet of oil tankers withsanctionsto staunch a stream of petrodollars to Putin\u2019s war chest. The US has also threatened to target importers of Russian oil. Friday marked the passing of Trump\u2019s deadline \u2014 although he said he believed Putin and Zelenskyy were still eager to secure an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

On Thursday, the Customs and Border Protection agency had published a ruling, which was first reported by the Financial Times, saying one-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars should beclassified with a customs codethat is subject to tariffs. Its decision stood in sharp contrast to a previous White House statement in April that bullion would be exempt from Trump\u2019s levies. Gold for December delivery dropped by 1 per cent to $3,460 per troy ounce on Friday after the FT reported on the White House\u2019s plan to clarify its tariff.

The US Comex is the world\u2019s largest financial market for bullion, but to function efficiently the market relies on having unfettered access to the physicalgoldmarket centred on London \u2014 which would be threatened by any levies, according to market participants. Many in the gold industry have questioned whether the CBP ruling, which was written in response to an inquiry from a Swiss refiner, could have been a bureaucratic mistake. \u201cThe US has to decide if the White House was wrong in April, or if the CBP is wrong now,\u201d said one executive. Switzerland was dealt a particularly heavy blow as a result of the US\u2019s tariffs decision, since the country is the world\u2019s largest refining hub. The tariff ruling would \u201cnegatively impact\u201d the flow of physical gold around the world, noted the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders in Precious Metals Association in astatementon Friday. Trump reignited his global trade war earlier this week by reimposing his reciprocaltariffson almost every US trading partner, pushing American import duties to their highest level in decades. But the US president has also offered a host of exemptions to the levies, including to products such as pharmaceuticals or chips, that the US may apply separate tariffs to in future. In April, the US issued further exemptions to a range of consumer electronics such as laptops, smartphones and earphones. Trump has also signalled he may be willing to offer carve-outs for companies such as Apple that promise to make big investments in the US.

The abrupt removal of the chief of the US government\u2019s tax collection and enforcement agency on Friday caps a period of extraordinary turmoil and turnover at theIRS. Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January there have been four acting commissioners at the IRS prior to the start of Long\u2019s tenure in June. Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, will now become acting commissioner of the IRS. The Treasury department oversees the tax agency so Long was already reporting to Bessent prior to his removal. Long said in a post on X on Friday that he had been tapped to be US ambassador to Iceland: \u201cIt is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\u201d The New York Times first reportedTrumpwas planning to remove Long, who was a former auctioneer, property agent and member of Congress before he took up the post at the IRS. The White House and Treasury did not explain why the president wanted him out of the tax service. A Treasury spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cHis zeal and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to the Federal Government was evident in both the House of Representatives and as part of the Trump Administration. A new candidate for Commissioner will be announced at the appropriate time.\u201d The IRS has shed about a quarter of its workforce since Trump\u2019s second term began as the White House moved rapidly to slash the size of government agencies. The dismissals of IRS staff this year stands in contrast to a boost in funding that former president Joe Biden enacted during his time in office in order to increase the agency\u2019s capacity to audit wealthy taxpayers. Long had recently placed two top IRS officials on administrative leave, said one person familiar with the matter. The New York Times on Thursday reported that Long sent an email to staff telling them they could leave work early on Friday. \u201cPlease enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Reeves hopes promise of fairness will cushion potential Budget tax rises", "content": " Anna GrossandDavid Sheppard PublishedAugust 8 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Rachel Reeves plans to link tax rises in the Budget with a promise of improved living conditions in the longer term, as the chancellor and her team begin drawing up a list of which measures she may tighten in the autumn. The chancellor is keen to try and soften the blow of any revenue raising measures on households, according to people close to her, but economists predict she may need to make drastic changes to fill a hole of around \u00a340bn in the public finances. \u201cThe budget is a moment, but she wants to make sure there\u2019s a bigger economic agenda pushing through,\u201d said one person close to the chancellor. The narrative around improving equity and fairness for working people is seen as key to fending off the threat posed by Nigel Farage, who has attracted former Labour voters with a simple message about economic and national decline, which he has tied to high levels of migration. People close to Reeves said she plans to drip feed announcements in the autumn, including finalising the Northern Powerhouse rail project and introducing fresh legislation to speed up planning for infrastructure projects such as data centres, that speak to the government\u2019s wider goal of improving productivity. Reeves sat down with Sir Keir Starmer this past week to go through which taxes to increase, a task made harder by the pledge not to increase income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. Treasury officials insist the three will not be touched in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge. Reeves is also working through a pile of proposals from Treasury officials for tax increases that economists believe could include measures such as freezing tax bands, raising duties on unhealthy foods and gambling, and even potentially increasing fuel duty. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said if the black hole was only \u00a320-\u00a325bn, this would allow the Treasury to \u201cmake some pretty sensible changes\u201d that would not inflict too much damage on the economy and could fit into a marketable centre-left story. Those measures could include prolonging a freeze on income tax band thresholds \u2014 a measure derided last year as \u201cunfair\u201d by Reeves \u2014 to increase receipts by around \u00a34bn a year, and moves such as increasing duties on unhealthy foods to tackle the obesity crisis. But Smith said if the black hole exceeded \u00a340bn, as many economists fear, the government would need to look at more drastic measures. \u201cThe big political call is whether to break one of the manifesto pledges,\u201d Smith said. Last year, ahead of the election, senior Labour figures were set on ruling out increases to National Insurance and income tax, but wavered for 24 hours before ruling out increases to VAT, according to officials. The UK deploys sales taxes more narrowly than many comparable countries. Broadening the scope of the tax rather than raising it may allow Reeves to claim the pledge is intact. Taxes on the gambling industry look almost certain to increase at the budget, a proposal championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown this week, who wants the \u00a33bn increase on duties paid by online betting groups to fund removing the contentious two-child benefit cap. But many other taxes are in play. Downing Street is keeping an open mind given uncertainty about the scale of the challenge the UK faces in balancing the national books. Starmer has laid down no red lines outside the manifesto pledge, leaving taxes such as fuel duty \u2014 normally seen as politically toxic \u2014 as an option, economists say. Increasing fuel duty would align with the wider Labour narrative about investing in net zero and electrification, though the level has been frozen for more than a decade. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour was \u201cgearing up to punish the British public with more tax rises\u201d.

They also asked Altman about the most embarrassing \u2014 and perhaps funniest \u2014 snafu in the presentation, the \u201cchart crime.\u201d One of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out isa real-time routerthat decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to \u201cthink\u201d through answers. But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT RedditcomplainedGPT-5 wasn\u2019t working as well for them as 4o did.\u00a0Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed \u201cdumber\u201d was the router wasn\u2019t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday. \u201cGPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,\u201d Altman promised. Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote. And Altman also promised, \u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.\u201d\u00a0This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts. Predictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many\u201cchart crime\u201d jokes. The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar. Altman didn\u2019t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a \u201cmega chart screwup\u201don X. Others noted the charts in thepublished blog post were correct. But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model\u2019s performance,also pointed outthat turning data into a table was \u201cgood example of a GPT-5 failure.\u201d In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most.

Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous postson social mediaurging users to turn off location sharing,incorrectly claimingthat it\u2019s automatically turned on. \u201cWe\u2019re double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\u201d Mosseri said in aThreads post. \u201cWe\u2019re still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\u201d Mosseri also said that somepeople are \u201cconfused\u201dabout how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. It\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you\u2019re still at the location). If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn\u2019t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps below. To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new \u201cMap\u201d option at the top. If it\u2019s your first time accessing the feature, you\u2019ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads \u201cWho can see your location.\u201d From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the \u201cStory, live and location\u201d option, and then tap the \u201cLocation sharing\u201d button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you\u2019ll be able to see them on the Map. When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you\u2019ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or \u201cNotes,\u201d on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they\u2019re shared with a location.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Former Googlers\u2019 AI startup OpenArt now creates \u2018brain rot\u2019 videos in just one click", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us AI-generated \u201cbrain rot\u201d videos are popping up all over the internet and getting a lot of attention. Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, likea shark wearing sneakersanda ballerina with a cappuccino for a head. One startup driving this trend isOpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users. The company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising. With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden. Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion. The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy. While these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation. During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June,Disney and Universalsued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder. \u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters. One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent. \u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said. Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app. OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member. OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey \u2014 around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases. Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users\u2019 interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. \u201cI think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything\u00a0\u2026\u201d Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,\u201d he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn\u2019t talk about it that way, usually, because it\u2019s not how users think of it. \u201cBut when users say things like \u2018Pinterest just gets me,\u2019 it\u2019s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they\u2019re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,\u201d he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a \u201cCambrian moment,\u201d and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch anew set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention ofmass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn\u2019t say if that\u2019s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including onFacebook,Instagram, andTumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that\u2019s used for good and used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d \u201cOn the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cBoth in terms of what we\u2019re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what\u2019s happening in the rest of social media,\u201d he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle. The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment.

Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May,Bloomberg reportedthat SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy.
