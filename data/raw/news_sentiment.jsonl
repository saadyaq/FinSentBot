However, by June, same-store sales began increasing again.\"Exiting the quarter, we returned to positive comp and transaction trends, which have continued into July,\" Boatwright told analysts on the company's conference call.He later reiterated the company's belief that it can return to same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits in the long term and achieve average unit volumes for its restaurants of $4 million.Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte have filed a US defamation lawsuit against Candace Owens, a rightwing influencer and podcaster who has said France\u2019s first lady \u201cis in fact a man\u201d. The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware on Wednesday, accuses Owens of publishing \u201coutlandish, defamatory and far-fetched fictions\u201d, chief among them thatBrigitte Macronwas born male under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux. Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing. The suit is a rare case of a serving world leader personally suing an online influencer over their content, though it comes days after Donald TrumpsuedThe Wall Street Journal and its parent companies over a report of a letter that the US president allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document.

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:51.522664", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:53.125133", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267}

Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:05:54.643603", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes revenue from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year,  a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivery 337,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

The 218-page lawsuit, filed in Delaware on Wednesday, accuses Owens of publishing \u201coutlandish, defamatory and far-fetched fictions\u201d, chief among them thatBrigitte Macronwas born male under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux. Owens has also said the French president and his wife were blood relatives and thatEmmanuel Macronwas a product of a CIA human experiment or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the Macrons\u2019 court filing. The suit is a rare case of a serving world leader personally suing an online influencer over their content, though it comes days after Donald TrumpsuedThe Wall Street Journal and its parent companies over a report of a letter that the US president allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document. It says: \u201cPresident Macron has not participated in, nor is he the product of, any government mind control programmes.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d9bf7d2b-b834-4c19-8c66-8629e3046f24", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:27.261187", "sentiment_score": -0.7160000205039978}

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:30.658590", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:32.212689", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267}

Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T21:36:33.764620", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. While Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariff\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future. \u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter. The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year,  a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivery 337,000 vehicles. Tesla said Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

The Macrons face a high legal bar, since US defamation laws require public figures to show \u201cactual malice\u201d, meaning that the person knew the information was false or had a reckless disregard for the truth. The Macrons are seeking a jury trial and punitive damages. \u201cThe principle here is truth,\u201d the Macrons\u2019 lawyer Thomas Clare, co-founder of defamation specialist firm Clare Locke, told the Financial Times. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s important to stand up for themselves\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Owens has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and in response she has only mocked them.\u201d He said the French president and first lady were willing to travel to Delaware to appear in person for the trial. \u201cBecause Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys\u2019 repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,\u201d the Macrons said in a statement. A spokesperson for Owens said she would respond on her podcast on Wednesday. \u201cCandace Owens is not shutting up,\u201d the influencer\u2019s spokesperson added. \u201cThis is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission.\u201d Owens, who is married to George Farmer, the former boss ofsocial media platform Parler, has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube and made her name as a conservative activist. The lawsuit says the Macrons have \u201csuffered substantial reputational damage\u201d and have spent \u201cconsiderable sums of money to correct the public record\u201d. The defamation case centres onBecoming Brigitte, an eight-part series that Owens released this year, and social media podcasts linked to it. In their filing, the Macrons say Owens has \u201cused [a] false statement\u201d about Brigitte\u2019s gender \u201cto promote her independent platform, gain notoriety and make money\u201d. They say she \u201cignored multiple attempts by the Macrons to engage\u201d. Becoming Brigittehas more than 2.3mn views on YouTube. \u201cOwens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history \u2014 twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\u201d the Macrons said in their filing. \u201cThe result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\u201d The theory about Brigitte Macron started in France in 2021, but has since been discussed by US media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Initially the Macrons did not take action so as not to amplify what they have called \u201ctoxic\u201d rumours, but in 2022 Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit in France against a blogger and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who relayed the claims. She initially won the case, but it was overturned on appeal and she is now challenging that decision. Last year, Emmanuel Macron reacted publicly for the first time, saying: \u201cThe worst thing is false information and fabricated scenarios, with people who end up believing them \u2014 including in \u200bthe \u200bmost private \u200baspects of your life.\u201d Owens, 36, was once a staunch Trump supporter. She and Farmer, the son of the British life peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, married in 2019 at Trump\u2019s winery in Virginia. But the podcaster has since broken with the president and said she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d that she once campaigned for him. The Macrons\u2019 filing includes a description of the circumstances in which they met. The president was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit high school in Amiens when he first encountered Brigitte, then a 39-year-old married teacher with three children. According to the filings, they \u201cformed a deeper intellectual connection\u201d when she directed a production of the 1971 Milan Kundera playJacques and His Masterin which Macron played the lead role, and later \u201cthe two began meeting regularly to collaborate\u201d on another play. Their relationship \u201cremained within the bounds of the law\u201d, the filings say. But when the teenager\u2019s parents found out about his \u201cstrong feelings for his teacher\u201d, they moved him to a different school. Before he left he told her that \u201cwhatever you do, I will marry you\u201d. The lawsuit says the Macrons wrote to Owens in December in a letter that \u201cpointedly denied that the president was statutorily raped\u201d. Owens mentioned in her series the idea that the French president was connected to MKUltra, a \u201csecret CIA programme that conducted human experiments to develop mind control techniques using drugs, psychological manipulation, and torture\u201d, or \u201ca similar government mind control programme\u201d, according to the document. It says: \u201cPresident Macron has not participated in, nor is he the product of, any government mind control programmes.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d9bf7d2b-b834-4c19-8c66-8629e3046f24", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:04.200495", "sentiment_score": -0.7160000205039978}

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US president\u2019s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Japan agreement made clear the terms of the shakedown,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cMost member states are holding their noses and could take this deal.\u201d Both sides would waivetariffson some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said. The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts. News of the prospective deal boosted the euro, which recouped earlier losses to trade flat on the day against the dollar. US stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent. The US has been charging an extra 10 per cent tariff on EU exports since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent. The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views a deal on those terms as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he heard a deal to end the trade dispute between the US and the EU would be agreed imminently. \u201cWe are hearing this very minute that there could be a decision\u201d on trade, Merz said, as he welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin for bilateral talks. Trump imposed higher, sectoral tariffs on cars and car parts earlier this year using national security laws. EU officials have pushed hard for carve-outs to those tariffs for European carmakers. Two of the people said thedeal struck between the US and Japanhad pushed Brussels towards grudging acceptance of a higher reciprocal tariff rate to avert a damaging trade war. The EU could still retaliate if Trump tried to push further or followed through on his threat to raise reciprocal duties to 30 per cent from August. That could include activating its anti-coercion instrument (ACI) \u2014 its so-called trade bazooka. Never before used, the ACI would give Brussels leeway to block US companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and restrict imports and exports. The bloc will continue to prepare a possible \u20ac93bn package ofretaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they could not agree a deal by August 1, the people added. A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "The world is run by old men in a hurry", "content": " Janan Ganesh PublishedJuly 23 2025 Your guide to what Trump\u2019s second term means for Washington, business and the world Europe, not America, is the great exception. In a world of nation states, it has the supranational EU. In a world that understands the permanence of violence, it came to believe that it had transcended such things. (Hence the embarrassed rush to re-arm now.) And in a world of old leaders, its Macrons and Melonis stand out ever more as prodigies. The numbers should amaze us. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin are all in their seventies. So are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The president and supreme leader of Iran are 70 and 86 respectively. The presidents of Nigeria and Indonesia are each 73. More than half of the world\u2019s population, and much of its land area and military capacity, is in the hands of men who are older than Ronald Reagan was when he entered the White House at what seemed a dicey 69. One of the destabilising forces in the world today is the advanced age of those who run it. For one thing, old leaders have an incentive to secure a legacy \u2014 a defining achievement \u2014 before time runs out for them. The unification of mainland China with Taiwan is an example of such a project. So is avenging the loss of Russia\u2019s prestige and \u201cstrategic depth\u201d after the cold war. Even Trump\u2019s haste to find a settlement in Ukraine, however invidious the details of such a peace might be to that nation, and to end world trade as we have known it, whatever the economic cost, suggests an old man in a hurry. The problem with aged leaders is not their health \u2014 almost all those named above are robust and lucid \u2014 but their incentives. As well as not having much time to leave a mark, they won\u2019t have decades of retirement in which to suffer the legal and reputational penalties of any disastrous act committed in office. We have to get our heads around, if not a paradox, then a surprise. Age, which \u201cshould\u201d instil caution and restraint in people, quite often emboldens them. This is as true of voters as of their leaders. Who would have guessed that western electorates would turn more anti-establishment as the median age increased? It was disproportionately the old who brought us Brexit andTrump. But it is the leaders who are worth dwelling on here. Even if all these septuagenarian office-holders were governing with care, the other problem is that replacing long-established leaders is itself destabilising. In democracies, at least, there is a process \u2014 if Trump chooses to respect the 22nd Amendment \u2014 but what is the succession plan for a Putin or Xi? There is scope not just for palace intrigue and counter-intrigue, but for the kind of public dissent that would be unthinkable when a regime is at its peak. The Arab spring happened in part because a cohort of north African leaders, such as Egypt\u2019s then octogenarian Hosni Mubarak, had grown old together. Imagine several far more powerful countries having to replace calcified regimes at the same time. And imagine trying to anticipate what comes after them. Putin and Erdo\u011fan have led their countries as head of government or state for almost all of this century. Xi and Modi have been in place for over a decade each. When Ali Khamenei became Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Soviet Union still existed. Netanyahu, like Lula, is a retread. To some extent, these countries \u2014 or at least their states \u2014 are products of their current leaders. There are few eerier experiences than asking a western spy or diplomat how a post-Putin Russia might act in the world. What comes back is elegant guesswork, or a shrug. Someone will correct me, but I can\u2019t think of another point in history when so many world leaders were reaching old age at the same time. (If \u201cold age\u201d sounds drastic, remember that nowhere is male life expectancy higher than 85.) Even on the eve of the first world war, now remembered as an era of whiskered decrepits sending teenagers into hell, the Kaiser was in his mid-fifties. How then has Europe, which now has thehighestmedian age of any continent, mostly avoided the trend to oldness among its leaders? It might have something to do with those other ways in which the continent is exceptional. In parts of the world that think in terms of hard power, clear lines of authority and the nation as something of a family to be guarded, it is natural enough to find \u201cparental\u201d leaders. Where government is a technocratic exercise, the gradual fine-tuning of a prosperous peace, that won\u2019t be so true. Notice that since Europe woke up to the harshness of the world with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain and Germany have elected unusually old heads of government. (Even then, neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Friedrich Merz is yet 70.) Either way, the world is living through a lesson in the perverse consequences of age. It seems that age confers wisdom, but also a certain liberation. It imposes a sense of social duty, but also a deadline for personal achievement. To explain the disorder of the modern world, it is far more intellectually proper to cite economic trends and grand historical forces. But perhaps part of the story is that a few old men are striving for a legacy in the time that is left to them. If so, it follows that things will get worse as their numbered days go by. janan.ganesh@ft.com", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d41a591-940d-4936-b79f-4c7857138903", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:07.325068", "sentiment_score": -0.007199999876320362}

Private equity firms made record use of a controversial tactic to cash out their clients by selling assets to themselves in the first half of the year, as they struggle to find external buyers or list holdings. Buyout groups used so-called continuation funds \u2014 in which a private equity group sells assets from one of the funds they manage to a fresher fund also managed by the firm \u2014 to exit $41bn of investments in the first six months of 2025, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. That was equal to a record 19 per cent of all sales by the industry, and 60 per cent higher than a year ago. The increasing reliance of private equity groups on continuation funds to exit older deals comes as the industry contends with a prolonged downturn in initial public offerings and takeover activity that has squeezed the amount of cash returned to investors. Private equity groups sit on more than $3tn in unsold deals and are nearing four consecutive years in which they have returned only about half the cash investors traditionally expect. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third or fourth year of low distributions, the exit environments are challenging and the IPO market is dormant,\u201d said Todd Miller, Jefferies global co-head of secondary advisory. Continuation funds give investors the choice to roll over their investment or to cash out. For their private equity sponsors, they allow the firm to keep portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year life of a fund, and to crystallise performance fees on the assets sold while collecting a steady stream of management fees from the new fund buying the investments. In the first half of the year, PE groups such as Vista Equity Partners, New Mountain Capital and Inflexion used multibillion dollar continuation funds to sell down some of their largest investments. Vista raised a record $5.6bn continuation fund to sell a large existing stake in IT firm Cloud Software Group to a newer fund it manages, while Inflexion sold stakes in four deals, including industrial company Aspen Pumps and Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, a UK pharma business, for \u00a32.3bn. Both deals locked in large gains for investors choosing to sell their stakes. \u201cNow this is a bona fide exit route for every [fund manager] out there,\u201d said Scott Beckelman, global co-head of secondary advisory at Jefferies. \u201cWe expect most sponsors will plan to do one or two of these out of every fund they raise, it\u2019ll be a regular exit that they underwrite.\u201d The report from Jefferies found that the secondary market, where both buyout firms and their institutional investors can trade stakes in existing assets, exploded in the first half of this year. More than $100bn of sales took place, an increase of almost 50 per cent from the same period last year. Slightly more than half of that came from fund investors \u2014 known as limited partners \u2014 selling their holdings. Continuation funds have drawn concern from some investors as a tactic for recycling capital, even as their popularity has surged, with an increasing number of institutional investors opting out of them. Beckelman said continuation funds would continue to gain popularity as a way for so-called financial sponsors to maintain ownership of their best investments, although the structure is also used to house less well-performing assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuation vehicles be applied when the sponsor has a great asset that they\u2019ve owned for a period of time and produced good results, but they have a longer term path to benefit from that compounding ownership,\u201d he said. But a recent report from Bain & Co, considered an authority in the industry, still showed that almost two-thirds of investors in private equity funds would prefer groups sell down investments the conventional way through sales to companies or initial public offerings. Just one-sixth of investors said they preferred continuation funds.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a4e3e3-cefb-48d8-ab81-75cf85039b83", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:08.867094", "sentiment_score": -0.6028000116348267}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Tom Hayes\u2019 conviction for Libor-rigging quashed by UK\u2019s highest court", "content": " Alistair Grayin London PublishedJuly 23 2025 UpdatedJuly 23 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Tom Hayes has emerged victorious in his decade-long battle to clear his name for rigging Libor benchmark rates after the UK\u2019s highest court quashed his conviction. The watershed Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday calls into question the UK\u2019s other rate-rigging prosecutions, which served as a lightning rod for public anger over the global financial crisis. Hayesbecame the public face of the Libor scandal, which first emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, amid widespread public anger against bankers. His legal team has called for a public inquiry and for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Hayes, to be abolished. The manipulation of the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate, which was used to set the interest rate on loans and derivatives throughout the financial system, sent shockwaves through markets and the fallout cost banks billions of pounds in fines and settlements. The former UBS and Citigroup banker was the first trader in the world to be found guilty by a jury ofrigging Libor, which was determined daily based on numbers submitted by several large banks. His conviction in 2015 was regarded as a rare example of a banker being held to account \u2014 even if the offence had little to do with the origins of the financial crisis. Hayes was originally handed a 14-year prison sentence, one of the UK\u2019s toughest sentences for white-collar fraud. Heserved five and a half years in prisonafter his sentence was reduced to 11 years on appeal. But in a decision handed down on Wednesday, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned his conviction. Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who received a four-year sentence for manipulating Euribor, another benchmark rate, also had his conviction quashed. Hayes and Palombo were among nine people successfully prosecuted by the SFO for rigging benchmark rates. The decision on Wednesday fell short of a full exoneration. The Supreme Court judges found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d during Hayes\u2019 trial that could have formed a basis for conviction. The SFO nevertheless said it would not seek a retrial in the case. \u201cWe have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial,\u201d it said. Hayes was convicted under sweeping fraud laws. However, the UK has since introduced a specific criminal offence of benchmark-rigging. In their unanimous decision, the judges said on Wednesday that the jury in Hayes\u2019 original trial at Southwark Crown Court had not been asked to determine a central question in the case. Jurors had been told that a Libor rate was inherently not \u201cgenuine or honest\u201d if it had been \u201cinfluenced by trading advantage\u201d. \u201cHayes was entitled to have his defence to the allegation that he agreed to procure false submissions as well as his denial that he had acted dishonestly left fairly to the jury,\u201d Lord Leggatt said. \u201cHe was deprived of that opportunity by directions which were legally inaccurate and unfair.\u201d \u201cIt is not possible to say that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have been bound to return verdicts of guilty. The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.\u201d Recommended In jubilant scenes among family and supporters outside the court, Hayes said: \u201cIt feels very surreal \u2014 a little bit like my conviction.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy faith in the criminal justice system in the UK at times was largely destroyed and it\u2019s been restored.\u201d The UK court\u2019s decision comes days after former HSBC currencies trading chief Mark Johnsonhad his criminal conviction for wire fraudin the US thrown out. Johnson was convicted as part of the forex-rigging investigation, which probed similar allegations to that of Libor-rigging and for which banks around the world also paid fines totalling about $10bn.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e6ea9954-37fa-4737-bc14-185770583fc2", "timestamp": "2025-07-23T22:07:10.400759", "sentiment_score": -0.6448000073432922}

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap. The company reported Wednesdayrevenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.) However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. While Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future. \u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter. The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. Tesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss. And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. Earlier this month, Tesla said itdelivered384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year, a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivered 337,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over\u00a0a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers.

But it also doesn\u2019t want the U.S.\u2019s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary. That\u2019s quite the balance to strike. If President Trump\u2019sAI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals. \u201c\u200b\u200bAmerica currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,\u201d the plan stated. \u201cIt is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.\u201d The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through \u201ccreative approaches\u201d followed by a pair of policy recommendations. The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn\u2019t a focus on many of the component subsystems \u2014 a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention. The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies. \u201cAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,\u201d the plan states. \u201cWe should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.\u201d The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines. The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there\u2019s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months \u2014\u00a0including just last week. In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD,the green light to start selling AI chipsthey had developed for China, just months after rolling outlicensing restrictions on the same AI chipsthat effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market. The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019sAI diffusion rule(which put a cap on how much\u00a0AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear. While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it\u2019s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.

TheTo Do List Summitwill cap off at 80 early-stage founders and will teach them how to work with the press and run their own social media, the organizers promise. The fee for the event is $600. YC laid off most of the folksputting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator\u2019s events have always been highly popular andwere a major force in making San Francisco the hubfor the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake ofstartups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,founders feel pressured to do the same. It\u2019s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and naba spot in a16z\u2019s Speedrun program.Defense tech startup Theseuslanded a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

They\u2019re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group\u2019s\u201cDirty Dozen\u201d listof the most contaminated produce. San Luis Obispo, California-basedTRIC Roboticsthinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots. The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops. The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,\u201d Stager said. \u201cWe found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we\u2019ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.\u201d While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn\u2019t even focused on agriculture to begin with. Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture. \u201cI really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?\u201d Stager said. \u201cI was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that\u2019s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.\u201d Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab. He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven\u2019t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC\u2019s robotics. \u201cWe loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,\u201d Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. \u201cWe had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that\u2019s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.\u201d Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way. TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels. The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well. \u201cI think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,\u201d Stager said. \u201cI just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there\u2019s really a lot of exciting things to come.\u201d  Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

{"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Trump\u2019s AI strategy trades guardrails for growth in race against China", "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump administration published its much-anticipatedAI Action Planon Wednesday, a document that takes a sharp shift away from former President Biden\u2019s cautious approach to addressing the risks of AI,\u00a0and instead barrels ahead with plans to build out AI infrastructure, cut red tape for tech companies, shore up national security, and compete with China. The downstream effects of this shift will likely ripple throughout various industries and may even be felt by the average American consumer. For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizesbuilding out data centersto power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king. The Trump administration positions this as the only way to \u201cusher in a new golden age of human flourishing.\u201d Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. \u201cTo secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,\u201d Trump said in astatement. \u201cTo do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u2018Build, Baby, Build!\u2019\u201d The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration\u2019s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan. At the start of this month, theSenate removed a controversial provisionin the budget bill that would bar states fromregulating AI for 10 years. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states\u2019 federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. It appears that matter hasn\u2019t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to \u201cunleash prosperity through deregulation,\u201d the administration threatens to limit states\u2019 federal funding based on their AI regulations. The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cevaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.\u201d In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet \u2014 which many do \u2014 then the FCC can get involved. On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action. Trump\u2019s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, likedata centers, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations \u2014 like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act \u2014 are hindering America\u2019s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America\u2019s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers \u2014 such as AI companies \u2014 can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods. Certain companies, like xAI andMeta, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities.Critics have accused xAIof bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep \u201cadversarial technology\u201d \u2014 like Chinese-made chips and hardware \u2014 out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the main standouts in Trump\u2019s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and \u201cAmerican values,\u201d in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks. \u201cIt is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.\u201d Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn\u2019t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who \u201censure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\u201d That language is similar to whatThe Wall Street Journal reportedwould be in Trump\u2019s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. \u201cThe only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,\u201d Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contractsworth up to $200 millioneach to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump\u2019s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. \u201cFor instance, an order that says, \u2018We won\u2019t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model\u2019 would likely violate the First Amendment,\u201d Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. \u201cAn order that says, \u2018We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral\u2019 would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it\u2019s so hard to know what\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 in these situations).\u201d He added: \u201cIf the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.\u201d Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, includingDeepSeekandAlibaba\u2019s Qwen. As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community\u2019s access to private AI models and data. American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach \u2014 including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face \u2014 could benefit from Trump\u2019s embrace of open AI. Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. Trump\u2019s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America\u2019s national security. Compared to Biden\u2019s AI executive order, Trump\u2019s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an \u201conerous\u201d task, which Trump seems to want to limit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing \u201cnational security\u201d threats from accessing advanced AI technology. Under Trump\u2019s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cNational security\u201d was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan \u2014 more than \u201cdata centers,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and other key terms. The plan\u2019s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats. Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.

Intelreported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue, as the company's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant cuts in chip factory construction. The stock ticked higher in extended trading.Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: Loss of 10 cents per share, adjusted.Revenue: $12.86 billion versus $11.92 billion estimatedIntel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, inthe year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not comparable to analyst estimates due to an $800 million impairment charge, \"related to excess tools with no identified re-use,\" the company said. That resulted in an EPS adjustment of about 20 cents.The report was Intel's second since Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March, promising to make the chipmaker's products competitive again, and to reduce bureaucracy and layers of management, including slashing staff in Oregon and California.In a memo to employees published on Thursday, Tan said that the first few months of his tenure had \"not been easy.\" He said that the company had \"completed the majority\" of its planned layoffs, amounting to 15% of the workforce, and that it plans to end the year with 75,000 employees. Intel previously said it was trying to reduce operating expenses by $17 billion in 2025.Intel shares are up about 13% this year as of Thursday's close after plummeting 60% in 2024, their worst year on record.Tan also announced several other spending cuts in the memo, particularly in the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and is still looking for a big customer to anchor the business.Intel said its foundry business had an operating loss of $3.17 billion on $4.4 billion in revenue.Tan said that Intel had cancelled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and will consolidate its testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. He added that the company would slow down the pace of its construction of a cutting-edge chip factory in Ohio, depending on market demand and if it can secure big customers for the facility.\"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon \u2013 without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote. \"In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.\"Tan wrote that the company's forthcoming chip manufacturing process, called 14A, will be built out based on confirmed customer commitments.\"There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,\" Tan wrote.The company's client computing group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, had $7.9 billion in sales, down 3% on an annual basis.Revenue in the data center group, which includes some AI chips but is mostly central processors for servers, rose 4% to $3.9 billion. Tan wrote in his memo that Intel wants to regain market share in data center chips, and is looking for a permanent leader for the business. Longtime rivalAdvanced Micro Deviceshas increasingly beenwinning server businessfrom cloud customers.Tan added he would personally review and approve all chip designs before they are taped out, which is the final step of the design process before a new chip is manufactured.WATCH:How U.S. companies are mitigating Trump tariffs with foreign trade zones", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/intel-intc-earnings-report-q2-2025.html", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:09:35.625466", "sentiment_score": -0.8683000206947327}

On Wednesday evening Tesla reported that second-quarter profitdeclinedmore than a fifth on slowing car sales. Musk said that Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-EV and solar power policies would further hit the company\u2019s earnings. \u201cWe\u2019re in this weird transition period where we\u2019ll lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said on Wednesday. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Trump\u2019s tax and spend actputs at riskthe billions of dollars in annual profit that Tesla makes from selling regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions.

His close relationship with Trump was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla but ended up alienating many left-leaning customers. After a tumultuous four months marked by clashes with Trump\u2019s cabinet, the world\u2019s richest man emerged as a leading critic of the administration\u2019s economic and trade policies, vowed to launch his own party and helped reignite speculation about the president\u2019s relationship with the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump in turn has suggested that the US government should turn Doge on Musk\u2019s empire, cancelling lucrative contracts for his companies that include SpaceX, its satellite broadband network Starlink and xAI. Tesla\u2019s adjusted net income fell to about $1.4bn for the second quarter, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn the previous year. Revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.7bn and its operating margin narrowed. \u201cThere was no attempt to sugar coat the market headwinds for EVs,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, adding that Tesla had to \u201ccross the chasm\u201d to the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, \u201cwhile absorbing slower volume, EV incentive elimination, tariffs and investing in new initiatives that may not make margins for years\u201d. Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Musk also renewed his threat to leave Tesla if he is not given more shares, after a Delaware judge struck down a pay package that would have been the largest in US history. If reinstated on appeal by Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court, the package would increase Musk\u2019s ownership of Tesla from just under 13 per cent to more than 20 per cent. \u201cThat is a major concern for me\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

Tesla has warned of a further hit to revenue from Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and anti-electric vehicle policies in the US president\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d, darkening the outlook as second-quarter profits fell by more than a fifth. Trump\u2019s signature fiscal legislation puts at risk a crucial source of profit for Tesla that had allowed the electric-vehicle maker to sell billions of dollars of regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The hit to Tesla from the president\u2019s policies \u2014 including the loss of EV and solar power incentives \u2014 has deepened chief executiveElon Musk\u2019s rift with Trump, pulling the world\u2019s richest man back into politics despite his promise to investors to refocus his attention on the electric-car maker. \u201cWe are in the transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe probably could have a few rough quarters.\u201d Teslashares fell 8 per cent in early trading on Thursday following Musk\u2019s comments. They have fallen more 30 per cent from a peak in mid-December. The billionaire\u2019s close relationship with Trump, after supporting his re-election bid, was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla. However, Musk\u2019s role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alienated some customers as he celebrated brutal cuts to the federal workforce. He left the White House in May after falling out with the president, becoming a fierce critic of the Republican\u2019s spending bill and pledging tolaunch his own political party. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. A consumer backlash against Musk\u2019s political activities has contributed to a sales slump at Tesla, which is also suffering from an ageing model line-up and greater EV competition from Chinese and western rivals. The Austin, Texas-based company on Wednesday reported that its adjusted net income came in close to analysts\u2019 expectations at $1.4bn for the three months through June, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn a year earlier. The carmaker warned Trump\u2019s policies would add to its difficulties in the coming months. Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla had a limited supply of vehicles and might not be able to deliver enough cars in time to meet orders if consumers rushed to beat the September deadline for the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases and leases. Teslastands to losemuch of the income from the sale of its regulatory credits after Trump\u2019s bill eliminated fines for non-compliance, throwing the future of emissions trading programmes in doubt. Revenue from the credits almost halved to $439mn in the quarter from a year before. Last year, the company made $2.8bn from these sales. The bill also threatens Tesla\u2019s other business lines by removing a range of incentives for renewable energy. Taneja said Tesla faced $300mn in additional tariff-related costs in the second quarter and warned this figure would increase through the year. The US has imposed higher tariffs on foreign-sourced cars and components, including battery cells that Tesla imports from China. \u201cWhile we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front,\u201d he added. In an attempt to revive its sales momentum, the company said it would aim to begin mass production of its delayed affordable model during the second half of the year. Recommended Tesla\u2019s revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.5bn in the second quarter from a year earlier, close to the average $22.7bn analyst estimate, according to data from Visible Alpha. Its operating margin dropped to 4.1 per cent, from 6.3 per cent. Reported net income declined 16 per cent to $1.2bn. With the slide in its automotive revenue, Musk has tried to convince investors that the company\u2019s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service, which launched in Austin last month. Musk said the number of robotaxis in operation would increase at \u201ca hyper-exponential rate\u201d, making the ride-hailing service available to half of the US population by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Despite the release of an upgraded version of its flagship Model Y sport utility vehicle, Tesla\u2019s sales have continued to sag in big European markets. Recommended Musk said he expected sales to improve in Europe if and when Tesla gets regulatory approval for its \u201cfull self-driving\u201d technology, which he said could happen this year. Earlier this month, Tesladisclosedit had sold 384,122 vehicles in the quarter, below the 389,000 forecast by analysts and down 13 per cent from 443,956 in the same period last year. Barclays analyst Dan Levy said the result was \u201cpositive, with improved fundamentals and narrative intact\u201d. But he added \u201cthe volume outlook remains uncertain\u201d and Tesla did not give a forecast for the number of cars it would build, as investors had expected.

District judge Robin Rosenberg on Wednesday argued that district courts did not have the power to release the records except in rare circumstances, and said the government\u2019s request was \u201cnot based on any of the exceptions\u201d to a federal rule governing the secrecy of grand jury files. The decision by the Florida judge came after Trump last week directed US attorney-general Pam Bondito unseal grand jury transcriptslinked to the financier, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The administration has faced weeks of mounting pressure over the Epstein case, which hasexposed fissuresin the president\u2019s Maga movement after he reneged on a campaign promise to make public files relating to the disgraced financier. A memo published by the justice department and FBI this month said there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that Epstein \u201cblackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions\u201d and that a \u201cclient list\u201d did not exist. That sparked outrage from some of the loudest voices in the Maga movement, many of whom called for Bondi to resign.Trumphas stood by his attorney-general. But the president faced fresh questions about his links to Epstein on Wednesday, when US media reported that Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche informed Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. Earlier this month, the president was asked by a reporter at the White House whether Bondi had told him that his name appeared in the files. He replied: \u201cNo, she has given us just a very quick briefing, and in terms of the credibility of the different things that they have seen.\u201d Trump has previously said he was Epstein\u2019s friend for 15 years, but claimed the two had a falling out more than 20 years ago. Recommended The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling in Florida. A Manhattan federal court is considering separate motions to unseal grand jury transcripts and a judge has asked the government for \u201cadditional submissions\u201d before ruling on whether to grant the request. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Bondi and Blanche stood by the memo from earlier this month, adding: \u201cNothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009as part of our routine briefing, we made the president aware of the findings.\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung said Trump kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club \u201cfor being a creep\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.\u201d Comments have not been enabled for this article.", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ef1ca342-28fa-4d02-9046-8495bded31ce", "timestamp": "2025-07-24T21:10:02.205487", "sentiment_score": -0.8029999732971191}
{"source": "Financial Times", "title": "Zelenskyy signals retreat from power grab after mass protests in Ukraine", "content": " Christopher Millerin Kyiv PublishedJuly 24 2025 UpdatedJuly 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to soften his stance on bringing the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies under executive control on Thursday, approving a new bill that he said would guarantee the agencies\u2019 independence after taking advice from the UK prime minister.Zelenskyy said the bill would be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament. He said earlier he had discussed the legislation with British premier Sir Keir Starmer, who \u201csuggested involving experts who could contribute to long-term co-operation on anti-corruption initiatives\u2019\u2019.Zelenskyy\u2019s statement and his call with Starmer came after the Ukrainian leader\u2019s push to subordinate the agencies to his handpicked prosecutor-general sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The move was condemned by the EU and G7 members, while critics accused Zelenskyy of an authoritarian power grab.It remains unclear how far the new bill will go towards restoring full independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Sapo).Ukrainians\u2019 frustration with the president has boiled over amid a deepening political crisis of his own making. Protests in Kyiv on Wednesday involved roughly 10,000 demonstrators \u2014 more than triple the previous day \u2014 who shouted \u201cshame\u201d and demanded that Zelenskyy \u201cveto the law\u201d. Thousands more turned out in other cities including Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa. \u201cEveryone has heard what people are saying,\u2019\u2019 Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday night address to the nation, seeking to assuage public concern. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not falling on deaf ears.\u201dYaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition MP who was among those who voted against the law, said on Thursday that he and 47 other lawmakers had submitted a draft law to revoke the amendments embedded in the earlier one that limited the powers of Nabu and Sapo. The president said his push to put the prosecutor-general, whom he appointed, in charge of Nabu and Sapo was aimed at rooting out Russian spies.The protests against the decision have been some of the biggest since the 2014 Euromaidan uprising that set Ukraine on a western course. Soldiers said they had been ordered by military leaders to avoid attending the protests and to refrain from posting criticism on social media. But many still came out in uniform to protest in Kyiv. One veteran and double-amputee at a rally near the president\u2019s office held a sign that read: \u201cWe are fighting for Ukraine, not your impunity.\u201d The criticism of Zelenskyy has been scathing, marking an unprecedented shift in Ukraine\u2019s wartime discourse. Since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, many Ukrainians had largely refrained from public dissent to prioritise national unity, but that consensus is now showing signs of strain.Critics said the original law, rushed through parliament with unusual speed and secrecy, resembled infamous \u201cdictatorship laws\u201d from 2014 that gave pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych extraordinary powers. Nabu and Sapo welcomed Zelenskyy\u2019s revised version of the bill and said it restored \u201call procedural powers and guarantees of the independence of Nabu and Sapo\u201d. They said in a statement: \u201cNabu and Sapo participated in the preparation of the text and urge the Verkhovna Rada to adopt the president\u2019s initiative as a basis and in full as soon as possible. This will help prevent threats to criminal proceedings investigated by Nabu and Sapo.\u201dIn Washington, before Zelenskyy\u2019s latest concessions, Democrat senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican senator Lindsey Graham published a statement on Wednesday praising the \u201cenormous strides\u201d Ukraine had made on anti-corruption since 2014 despite Russia\u2019s aggression. But they added, \u201cwe fear [the new law] undermines much of that progress\u2019\u2019. The situation has unfolded as Russian forces gain territory in Ukraine at their fastest pace in more than a year and the air war escalates. Russian drone strikes overnight in the historic centre of Odesa injured at least four people, according to regional governor Oleh Kiper. The attack came hours after a third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul ended without significant progress towards ending the war. The Kremlin on Thursday said it did not see how Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy could meet before the end of August. Zelenskyy has said the issues\u00a0central to ending the largest armed conflict on European soil in generations could only be settled in a face-to-face meeting between himself and Putin.

On Thursday, the Community Notes X accountannouncedthe launch of a pilot test where select contributors would be able to rate posts by answering questions about why they either like or don\u2019t like that particular post. The system is similar to how Community Notes fact-checking works. Instead of simply allowing users to upvote or downvote posts for accuracy \u2014 something that could be easily gamed if like-minded contributors teamed up to promote their own views \u2014 Community Notes uses something called a \u201cbridging algorithm.\u201d This attempts to find consensus among people who don\u2019t usually share the same views. If users whose opinions typically differ both agree that a fact-check is accurate, the note is published and made visible to the public. While X\u2019s system has been criticized for being too slow and unable to keep up with the massive amounts of misinformation that circulate on the platform, this same idea has sincebeen adopted by Metaas a replacement for fact-checking. Now X intends to see if Community Notes could help identify the best posts, too. Starting today, the company says that a subset of Community Notes contributors will begin seeing a new callout in the product when a post is gaining attention in the form of Likes. Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives. In aposton the Community Notes X account, the company explains the experiment could bring awareness to \u201cwhat resonates broadly.\u201d \u201cPeople often feel the world is divided, yet Community Notes shows people can agree, even on contentious topics. This experimental new feature seeks to uncover ideas, insights, and opinions that bridge perspectives,\u201d the post states. \u201cFollowing the path we used to develop Community Notes, we\u2019re building in public with a small pilot so that this concept can be shaped by the people.

For about six months, Thorpe was a prolific volunteer contributor to an open source project led by database companyTurso. His work was impressive enough that Turso\u2019s CEO,Glauber Costa, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer. \u201cI checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,\u201d Costa told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a story I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dIt\u2019s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he hasworked full-timefrom his cell at a venture-funded, San Francisco-based startup since May. \u201cI reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,\u201d Costa said. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today\u00a0\u2026Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.\u201d Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative. Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later. \u201cI was a complete idiot,\u201d Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. \u201cI had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.\u201d Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew. \u201cWhen I came to Maine, it was completely different,\u201d he reminisced. \u201cCOVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance \u2014 there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it\u2019s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: \u2018I\u2019m going to make something of myself.\u2019\u201d At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe enrolled remotely at the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk. \u201cAfter consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cHis students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.\u201d Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support. \u201cMaine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,\u201d Haley Shoaf, co-executive director ofUnlocked Labs, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons. \u201c[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,\u201d Shoaf said. Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift. \u201cWhen I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,\u201d Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. \u201cI began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.\u201d While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison \u2014 the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child \u2014 Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like. \u201cI have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cWhen they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, \u2018If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.\u2019\u201d The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners\u2019 return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it\u2019s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?\u201d Commissioner Liberty said. \u201cMany states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% \u2014 you don\u2019t come back at all.\u201d Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum-security prison in Maine saw only seven assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017. \u201cWhen you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,\u201d Shoaf said. Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty\u2019s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man. \u201cIt\u2019s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cAll the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn\u2019t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.\u201d Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming. \u201cHe was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,\u201d Costa said. In the open source community, where developers often can\u2019t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself \u2014 a Linux-obsessed engineer who\u2019s interested in relational databases \u2014 and not as a criminal. \u201cThe worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cLetting someone have a career gives you purpose.\u201d  Topics Senior Writer Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The release allows early adopters to get their hands on Apple\u2019s latest software before its wider public availability later this fall. The update represents the most notable visual transformation since iOS 7,featuring a \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d designthat offers a more transparent, glass-like feel to user interface elements, like buttons, screens, and in-app navigation and controls, among other things. Liquid Glass is integrated throughout iOS 26, including in key apps like Phone, Camera, Safari, Music, and others, as well as in notifications, theLock Screen, Control Center, and the Home Screen. The software update also includes an redesigned Lock Screen for iPhone and iPad with a 3D photo effect and dynamic clock and updated app icons, which users can now set to clear, too. In terms ofAI features, the new software brings alive translation featurethat translates conversations in real time, AI-powered shortcuts,poll suggestions in Messages, and an update to Visual Intelligence for conducting image searches as you browse. Other software versions, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26, have also adopted the Liquid Glass design. Here is a brief overview of all the new features being introduced. In addition to the glass aesthetic, iPhone users have several updates to be excited about, including adedicated gaming appthat serves as a new destination for playing and discovering games in one place. The Phone app is introducing a new Call Screening feature that prompts unknown callers to state their name and reason for calling before the recipient answers. Additionally, a Hold Assist feature will notify users when hold music ends, signaling that they can speak to a live agent. The app, along with Messages and FaceTime, will also support real-time live translations. In the Messages app, meanwhile, users can expect a feature that has AI-generated suggestions for polls. In addition, iOS 26 will bring updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, as well asimprovementsto Camera, Photos, Maps,and a range of other minor additions, including the ability to customize alarm snooze times. A big win for iPad users is that they\u2019ll experience a moreMac-like tablet. For example, iPadOS 16 is bringing the Preview app from macOS, which enables annotation on PDFs. Plus, a new windowing system that lets users adjust the size of web pages and apps, as well as manage multiple windows and tabs at once. One notable update formacOS 26involves Spotlight, which will employ AI to anticipate user searches and suggest actions based on frequently performed tasks or ongoing projects. Additionally, macOS is gaining Live Activities, allowing users to sync activities directly with their iPhones and access recent calls and contacts. One of the more significant features coming to the newwatchOSis Workout Buddy, a fitness assistant powered by Apple Intelligence that provides motivation using a generative AI voice during workouts, pointing out key moments like closing the Exercise ring for the day. Apple has also revamped the Workout app, introducing a helpful new option called Autoplay Media. This feature automatically starts playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Additionally, Apple Music can intelligently recommend the most suitable playlists for your workouts and will recall listening habits for each type of exercise. Another update is the automatic volume adjustment capability, which adjusts the volume of calls, timers, alarms, and Siri to match the surrounding sound levels, ideal for quiet places like libraries. Apple also introduced a new one-handed flick gesture that\u2019s designed to dismiss notifications, silence incoming calls, and return to the watch face, among other actions. Arguably, the most useful new feature coming to Apple\u2019s TV operating system is the ability to switch profiles seamlessly. Users can easily select their profile as soon as the Apple TV wakes from sleep, allowing them to quickly resume their viewing experience. Apple Music introduced a fun feature that enables users to use their iPhones as microphones for sing-alongs, complete with on-screen lyrics displayed on the TV. Multiple iPhones can connect at once, making it possible for friends and family to join in, queue songs, and even send emoji reactions. Additionally, new Contact Posters for FaceTime allow users to showcase customized photos and names, personalizing the experience. Another notable update includes the expansion of Live Captions to support translations in languages such as French, German, and Spanish.

Today, more than 20% of daters report using AI for things like crafting dating profiles or sparking conversations, per a recentMatch.com study. Some are taking it further by forming emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with AI companions. Millions of people around the world are using AI companions from companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI, including72% of U.S. teens. Some people have reportedfalling in love with more general LLMs like ChatGPT. For some, the trend of dating bots is dystopian and unhealthy, a real-life version of the movie \u201cHer\u201d and a signal that authentic love is being replaced by a tech company\u2019s code. For others, AI companions are a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy is increasingly hard to find. A recent study found thata quarter of young adultsthink AI relationships could soon replace human ones altogether. Love, it seems, is no longer strictly human. The question is: Should it be? Or can dating an AI be better than dating a human? That was the topic of discussion last month at an event I attended in New York City, hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. TechCrunch was given exclusive access to publish the full video (which includes me asking the debaters a question, because I\u2019m a reporter, and I can\u2019t help myself!). Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the \u201cOn with Kara Swisher\u201d podcast and is the current host of \u201cSmart Girl Dumb Questions.\u201d Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that \u201cAI is an exciting new form of connection \u2026 Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.\u201d Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled \u201cThe Intimate Animal.\u201d You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments. Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can\u2019t get in their human relationships. \u201cAI listens to you without its ego,\u201d Ha said. \u201cIt adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.\u201d She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to \u201cyour fallible ex or maybe your current partner.\u201d \u201cThe one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, \u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?\u201d Ha conceded that since AI doesn\u2019t have a consciousness, she isn\u2019t claiming that \u201cAI can authentically love us.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t have theexperienceof being loved by AI. Garcia countered that it\u2019s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that\u2019s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That\u2019s not \u201can honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,\u201d he argued. \u201cThis idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. \u201cI think if we\u2019re using it as a tool to build skills, yes \u2026 that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThe idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.\u201d According to a Match.comSingles in America study, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI. \u201cNow I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha\u2019s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it goes to my point, that they\u2019re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn\u2019t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.\u201d Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don\u2019t trust AI. \u201cAccording to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,\u201d Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGov poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions. \u201cA little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don\u2019t trust.\u201d Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships. \u201cThey are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,\u201d Ha said. \u201cI think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.\u201d AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through. But it\u2019s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we\u2019re in, many people have been feeling \u201ctouch starvation\u201d \u2014 a condition that happens when you don\u2019t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone. Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits. \u201cThe potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,\u201d Ha said. \u201cThe tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.\u201d Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors \u2014 especially if that\u2019s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI. That concern is not unfounded.Multiple studieshave shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, aremore likely to be sexually aggressivewith real-life partners. \u201cWork by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,\u201d Garcia said. He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners. \u201cWe have enough of that in society,\u201d he said. Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design. Of course, she made that comment before the White House released itsAI Action Plan, which says nothing about transparency \u2014 which many frontier AI companies are against \u2014 or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.
