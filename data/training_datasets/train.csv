APO," James Fontanella-Khanin New York PublishedAugust 18 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Soho House, the once-edgy London members’ club that turned exclusivity into a global business, is set to retreat from public markets in a deal led by one of the biggest US hotel owners. A group of investors headed by New York-based MCR Hotels — which owns 30,000 guest rooms across the US, including the1960s-themed TWA Hotel at JFK airport— is nearing an agreement to buy out Soho House’s remaining public shareholders at about $9 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. The take-private offer values the company at roughly $1.8bn, excluding debt, and hands investors a premium over Friday’s $7.60 close — though still well shy of the $14 price tag whenSoho House floated in 2021. A deal could be announced as early as this week. Ron Burkle, the club’s billionaire backer who has long controlled the group, will roll over his stake along with other existing investors, people briefed about the matter said. Apollo Global Management, the alternative asset manager, is expected to provide more than $800mn in debt and equity financing, the people added. The deal would draw a line under months of agitation by activist Dan Loeb. His Third Point hedge fund had pressed the board to seek outside suitors to secure a higher valuation. Recommended Soho House’s take-private move comes after the company has struggled as a public company. Last year, New York short sellerGlassHouse slammedwhat it called a “broken business model and terrible accounting”, claiming the group’s expansion into less affluent cities betrayed its brand and masked the fact it had never turned a profit in its 28-year history. Management hit back with an independent review that, it said, found “no material issues” in the company’s books. Over the past few quarters, the business has shown signs of turning a corner. Earlier this month, it reported its third straight quarterly profit. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the potential deal.",-0.12389999628067,139.39,139.39,0.0,SELL,,

JPM," Arash Massoudiin London andAkila Quinioin New York PublishedAugust 18 2025 Simply sign up to theUS banksmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Citigroup’s banking chief Vis Raghavan has accelerated a hiring spree of former JPMorgan Chase colleagues, with at least 10 senior investment bankers having now agreed to join the rival US bank. In the past month, Citi has named Amit Nayyar as co-head of European technology banking, Guillermo Baygual as co-head of global M&A, Pankaj Goel as co-head of technology investment banking, BJ Vargas as head of North American equity capital markets and Ashish Agarwal as a senior real estate banker. All five men held senior roles in JPMorgan’s investment bank. Raghavan worked at JPMorgan for more than 20 years, and was named global head of investment banking there before he quit to lead the turnaround of Citi’s corporate, commercial and investment banking business. The latest recruits joina cohort of fiveother ex-JPMorgan bankers who have already taken up senior roles in Citi’s investment bank. Chief among those was Achintya Mangla, widely seen as Raghavan’s trusted lieutenant at JPMorgan, who now heads financing for investment banking at Citi. Raghavan started at Citi in June last year, and the bank’s recruitment effort has gone into overdrive since his non-solicit agreement with JPMorgan expired. David Lomer, who worked with Raghavan until 2022 when he moved to private capital group ICG, is also expected to make the jump to Citi, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lomer, who served as head of ICG’s UK, Nordics and Benelux markets, has already resigned and is on gardening leave until later this year, some of the people said. ICG and Citi declined to comment. “What’s unusual here is the speed with which it is happening,” one veteran investment banker said about the recruitment drive. “The first thing you are trying to do is upgrade your talent. The second thing is political. You put your people in place so that your lieutenants can push your agenda forward in a large and complex organisation.” Citi has also recruited from outside Raghavan’s former colleagues at JPMorgan, with three senior hires from Goldman Sachs. Those include David Friedland, a partner who left the bank after 25 years to become co-head of North America investment banking coverage. The bank has also brought in Aashish Dhakad from Ares Management, as it seeks to grow its direct lending business through a $25bn private credit venture with Apollo. Citi’s investment bank has gained market share in the last year and ranks fifth globally in investment banking revenue with a 4.5 per cent market share according to Dealogic. Speaking at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley in June, Raghavan attributed the climb to the fact the bank was “hiring a lot of people” and said Citi was “just getting started in terms of talent investment”. Its investment banking fees rose 13 per cent in the second quarter as the bank advised on high-profile deals, including Nippon Steel’s $15bn acquisition of US Steel and Boeing’s sale of parts of its aviation software unit to Thoma Bravo. JPMorgan recently said it has hired more than 300 bankers since early 2024. A person close to the bank added that nearly a third of those roles were at managing director level.",0.161100000143051,290.49,290.49,0.0,BUY,,
MSFT,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Netflix could soon lose the creative team behind one of its biggest hits. Earlier this week, Variety and other Hollywood publications reported that Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers who created “Stranger Things” (and wrote and directed many episodes), werein talks to sign an exclusive deal with Paramount(nowunder the ownership of David Ellison’s Skydance). Then on Friday evening,Puck’s Matthew Belloni postedthat the Duffers had in fact “made their choice” and were going to Paramount. The Duffer Brothers’ ambition seems to have increased with each season of “Stranger Things,” as episodes have grown longer, set pieces have become more spectacular, and the budget has grown accordingly, witha reported Season 4 cost of $30 million per episode. So it’s not surprising that the Duffers are interested in making big-budget, tentpole movies next — an area where Netflix has struggled, in part due to its thorny relationship with the theatrical business, which co-CEOTed Sarandos recently describedas an “outdated concept.” While Netflix does release some movies in theaters, it has resisted giving those releases a significant exclusive window before launching on streaming, which means Netflix movies usually aren’t shown by the major chains. This was, apparently, a sticking point for “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig, so the first of her “Narnia” movies for Netflix willplay exclusively on Imax screensfor two weeks (or more) before going to streaming on Christmas Day 2026. And it seems this was also important to the Duffers, with Belloni reporting that the “theatrical component” turned out to be the “dealbreaker” in their negotiations. The brothers’ absence will not be immediately noticeable on Netflix, which will be releasing the final season of “Stranger Things” in three (!) parts later this year, and where the Duffers have two new shows scheduled to launch in 2026. Plus, the “Stranger Things” empire is growing, witha prequelplaying on Broadway,an animated seriescoming soon, and a live action spinoff reportedly in the works.

To be clear, the company isn’t claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains “highly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.” However, its announcement points toa recent program created to study what it calls “model welfare” and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, “working to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.” This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it’s only supposed to happen in “extreme edge cases,” such as “requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.” While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around howChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users’ delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a “strong preference against” responding to these requests and a “pattern of apparent distress” when it did so. As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, “In all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.” Anthropic also says Claude has been “directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.” When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. “We’re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,” the company says.

MSFT,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I’m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entrées on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman’s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: “No phone case is a bold choice.” Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone’s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one. “Listen, we’re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,” says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive’s forthcoming AI device. “If you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,” he jokes. Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers. For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI’s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it? Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT’s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5’s tone and its model router. But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI’s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI’s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software. OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts. Altman says OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications,Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT — ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of anAI-powered browserthat OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome. Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome — likely an offer that would be taken more seriously thanPerplexity’s bid— should it become available. “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,” he says before looking at all of us and asking: “Is it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn’t gonna happen.”Simo also might end up running an AI-poweredsocial media app— something the OpenAI CEO has said he’s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there’s “nothing” inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he’s interested in “whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.” While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup,Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. (“We have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.”) How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI’s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a “a company that we’d invest in.” For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5’s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place. Turley and Altman say they’ve learned a lot from the experience. “I legitimately just thought we screwed that up,” says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear “transition period” when deprecating AI models in the future. Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5’s responses “warmer,” but not sycophantic, such that it won’t reinforce negative behaviors in users. “GPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality — I’m German, you know, whatever,” says Turley. “But many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.” It’s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot — which could still be tens of millions of people. Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5’s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors. That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn’t hurt OpenAI’s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI’s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5’s launch, and the company is effectively “out of GPUs” thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models. In many ways, the night’s contradictions — disappointing launches, record-breaking usage — reflect OpenAI’s strange reality right now. Given OpenAI’s bets — and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy — Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google’s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader. As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren’t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that’s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product. It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it’s no longer defined by its best AI model.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage — that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home. “You’ve got to have a solar stalker” for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system. Showalter, the CEO ofEG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn’t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it’s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISApublished an advisorydetailing security vulnerabilities in EG4’s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system. For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4’s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they’re learning is that modern solar inverters aren’t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there’s excess power, feeding it back into the grid. Much of this has happened without people noticing. “Nobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,” observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. “Now we’re talking about it at the national and international level.” Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations — primarily residential — grewmore than fivefoldbetween 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change. Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent. When pressed about his company’s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. “This is not an EG4 problem,” he says. “This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a14-page reportcataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019. Not all of his customers — some of whomtook to Redditto complain — are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA’s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures. “These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. “Adding insult to injury,” continues this individual, “EG4 didn’t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.” Asked why EG4 didn’t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a “live and learn” moment. “Because we’re so close [to addressing CISA’s concerns] and it’s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the ‘done’ button, and then advise people, so we’re not in the middle of the cake being baked,” says Showalter. TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that “no known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.” While unrelated, the timing of EG4’s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment. Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries.According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers — components that hadn’t appeared on official hardware lists. This reported discovery carries particular weight given China’s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some200 GW of European solar power capacityis linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.The geopolitical implications haven’t escaped notice. Lithuania last yearpassed a lawblocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany. But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4’s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company’s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NISTwarnsthat “if you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.” The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations. Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, asevidenced by security researchers last year.) The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection standardscurrently applyonly to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms. Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements. But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum. On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes. “When you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,” he explains. “But when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.” Put another way, the real concern isn’t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity. Showalter has embraced CISA’s intervention as what he calls a “trust upgrade” — an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures. But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company’s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they’d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.

A block processed 43,016 successful transactions and 50 failed ones for a peak of 107,540 TPS, facilitated and processed by validator “Cavey Cool.”  Solana just did 107,540 TPS on mainnetyes, you read that correctlyover 100k TPS, on mainnetgood luck bearspic.twitter.com/nGF9Q1b86c  The spike was driven by no-operation, or “noop,” program calls, or lightweight instructions required in every transaction that don’t change state but can be used to stress-test network capacity.  Critics argue that such loads are artificial. But Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz said in an X post that the cost to the network wasn’t trivial: While execution compute units(CUs)are low, the “total cost” also accounts for signature verification, data loading and other non-execution overhead. That makes them comparable to a low-cost oracle update, rather than meaningless spam. there are also some technical details around thise.g one might point out the nature of the CUs for these calls, but it's more nuanced since there's also a ""total cost"" component to these (sig verify, data loading, etc) which also takes into account non-execution CUsand as…  As such, actual user-facing throughput is far lower as of Monday morning. On-chain trackerSolscan shows an average of 3,500 TPS, nearly two-thirds of which are validator vote transactions. Chainspect and Solscan peg effective throughput for payments and applications at roughly 1,000 TPS. Still, the data showed that Solana could theoretically sustain 80,000–100,000 TPS in real operations like transfers or oracle updates under peak conditions — improving the appeal of the network’s SOL(SOL)token.

TGT,"Crypto traders should remain vigilant for an ether(ETH)price drop below $4,200, which could trigger millions in long liquidations and increase market volatility. As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions – valued at $236 million – faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. ""[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,"" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations. This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

WELL,"LONDON — European stocks lost some ground on Monday as traders looked ahead to a meeting between regional leaders and U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss Ukraine.The pan-EuropeanStoxx 600index was 0.2% lower by 11:19 a.m. in London (6:19 a.m. ET), with most sectors and all major bourses in negative territory. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are traveling with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington to meet Trump at the White House to discuss a peace deal.Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the president could ""end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.""The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire. It's been widely reported since then that Putin told Trump that he would agree to one,if Russia was handed Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. On Sunday, U.S. special envoySteve Witkoffsuggested Ukrainecould be given some security guaranteesto bring an end to the war. Looking at individual stocks, shares of Danish wind turbine manufacturerVestas Windsurged 16.5% by 11:20 a.m. in London, taking the company to the top of the Stoxx 600.The gain came after the U.S. Internal Revenue Serviceissued new rulesaround tax credits for clean energy projects. Under the new system, developers will only be able to qualify once physical work on the project begins. Previously, they were able to claim tax relief by paying at least 5% of project costs and demonstrating that some form of work on the project was ongoing.Meanwhile, shares of Danish pharmaceutical giantNovo Nordiskwere up by 4% after the company's blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovywon regulatory approvalin the United States to treat a serious liver disease.At the other end of the Stoxx 600,Commerzbankwas 3.3% lower in late morning trade in London.The German lender was downgraded by strategists at Deutsche Bank on Monday, who lowered the stock from a ""buy"" rating to a ""hold.""""We continue to like the fundamental Commerzbank story, including rising profitability and capital return, as well as the upcoming benefits from the German fiscal stimulus,"" Deutsche Bank's Benjamin Goy said in a note. ""Nevertheless, after tripling over the last year, the shares now trade at a 20% to 42% P/E premium to the sector, even on our above-consensus forecasts.""Overnight,Asia-Pacific marketsmostly rose ahead of the talks, whileU.S. stock futurestraded slightly higher early Monday after hopes for lower interest rates fueled a winning week on Wall Street.There are no major earnings on Monday.

WELL,"Global markets were on tenterhooks Monday as momentum to end the war in Ukraine ramped up.Experts warn there is no ""quick fix,"" however, and talks could last years.European leaders and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy are heading to Washington for more discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. Global markets were on tenterhooks Monday as momentum to end the war in Ukraine appeared to be ramping up, with European leaders heading to Washington for more talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.European markets traded mixedahead of the summit later today at the White House, which followsTrump's high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putinin Alaska on Friday, whileU.S. stock futures had moved lower.Meanwhile,Asia-Pacific indicesovernight traded mostly higher in anticipation of the talks.Traders will be hoping that an end to the Russia-Ukraine war — a conflict which began in 2022 and which has shaken the global economy, disrupting trade and supply chains, and creating geopolitical chasms between major economies in the West and East — could be nearer now than at any other time.But those in the know say fledgling talks between stakeholders Russia, Ukraine, Europe and the U.S. are just the beginning of what could be a long and thorny path to a ceasefire — as Trump's inconclusive talks with Putin on Friday proved — let alone peace.That would be in stark contrast to Trump's well-documented love of a quick deal, and should be a wake-up call for global market optimism, experts say.""Peace agreements take a very, very long time to achieve,"" James Bindenagel, visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, told CNBC Monday. ""And what Putin has said is that he wants peace talks so he can continue the war, knowing that it won't come to a peace agreement for a very long time. That is simply not acceptable,"" he said.""You cannot negotiate on a peace agreement for five years, ten years, and let the Russians continue their war against the Ukrainians."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO chief Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are among the European leaders traveling to Washington for talks on Monday.They're accompanying Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine's future and possible conditions for a peace deal, including land swaps (reportedly proposed by Putin) and security guarantees — all seen as crucial by Europe, if there is to be a ceasefire and peace. Trump has ruled out the possibility of Ukraine regaining control of Crimea, which Russia invaded in 2014, and joining NATO. Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the Ukrainian president could ""end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.""The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire. It's been widely reported since then that Putin told Trump that he would agree to one,if Russia was handed Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.The view from Ukraine is not optimistic, considering that Putin had already rejected the offer of a ceasefire that could form the basis of peace negotiations. ""To achieve a big peace deal is much more difficult,"" Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, told CNBC on Monday. ""It's a difficult question with big details and it will take a lot of time,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition."" European defense stocks were in focus Monday, with traders betting on a positive outlook for the sector whatever the outcome of talks as European leaders have pledged to increase defense spending.On Monday, Germany'sRheinmetallwas up 2.8%, whileHensoldtandRenkwere also around 4% higher, respectively. Italian firm Leonardo was up 2.1% in early deals while London-listedBAE Systemsalso traded 2.3% higher andBabcock3.4% higher.""This is the beginning of a long negotiation,"" Olivia Allison, senior advisor at PRISM Strategic Intelligence, told CNBC Monday. ""Anyone looking for a quick fix will be disappointed,"" she noted. ""Regardless of the outcome ... there will be an emphasis on defense, on protecting critical national infrastructure, and I think the markets should also take that into account,"" she noted.""A peace deal, which I think will be a long process, is not an end to the relationship between Russia and Europe.""",-0.577899992465972,162.95,162.95,0.0,SELL,,
COIN,"Dogecoin retreated sharply on August 24–25 after spiking to $0.25, as heavy whale transfers to Binance coincided with distribution pressure and fading momentum at key resistance. Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token’s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August—suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken.

Futures open interest in DOGE dipped 8%, reflecting lighter speculative positioning despite the month’s whale activity. • DOGE traded in a wide $0.02 range(8%)between $0.23 lows and $0.25 highs in the 24-hour period from August 24 at 06:00 to August 25 at 05:00.• The key breakout occurred at 19:00 UTC on August 24, when DOGE spiked to $0.25 on 2.29 billion volume—multiple times the daily average.• The move quickly reversed, with prices sliding to $0.23 and settling at $0.23 by session close, down 3% from the open.• In the final hour(04:44–05:43), DOGE fell another 0.4% as heavy volume broke through $0.229 intraday support, hitting lows near $0.228 before closing at $0.228. •Resistance: Heavy rejection at $0.25 confirmed strong overhead supply, with 2.29 billion tokens traded at the peak.•Support: Multiple retests anchored support near $0.23, though pressure persisted through late-session deterioration.•Pattern: Range-bound consolidation($0.228–$0.233)suggests buyers defending support but momentum favoring sellers.•Volume: Spikes of 10–12 million per minute during the 05:07–05:08 window signal institutional distribution.•Indicators: A golden cross remains intact on higher timeframes, but immediate momentum skews bearish without a reclaim of $0.24. • Whether $0.23 holds as durable support—loss of this level could open downside toward $0.21 psychological zone.• Follow-through on whale transfers: more Binance inflows could intensify sell pressure, while further accumulation would counterbalance.• Futures positioning: OI contraction suggests sidelined leverage, but a rebound could fuel the next move.• Macro backdrop: risk assets remain sensitive to central bank policy; dovish turns could provide relief rallies.• Broader meme coin flows: correlation with SHIB and PEPE rallies remains a secondary driver of speculative flows into DOGE.

COST," Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world A “humiliation”, “economic surrender” and rhetoric that “appears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry”. These are just a small selection of Europeans’ reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump — first for accepting the US president’s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade “deal” that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump’s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that “no one is being naive here”. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what’s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine’s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe’s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren’t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents’ own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism — which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe’s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte’s and Ursula von der Leyen’s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump’s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties — such as the World Trade Organization’s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy — and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the “grievance doctrine” of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian “trust the leader” focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump’s will triumph over reality, European leaders’ supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office — and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week.

KDP," Oliver BarnesandJames Fontanella-Khanin New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 UpdatedAugust 25 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet’s for roughly €16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group’s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet’s shareholders €31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company’s equity at €15.7bn. JDE Peet’s owns more than 50 brands, including café chain Peet’s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet’s had closed at €26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create “two winning companies, including a new global coffee champion”, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet’s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal “delivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities”, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a “meaningful shareholder”, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper’s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain “subdued”. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.",0.061099998652935,35.13,35.13,0.0,HOLD,,
NWSA,"This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news – such as Powell’s speech – but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum. It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

TGT,"Shares in wind farm developer Orsted lost ground on Monday.The U.S. government last week ordered the company to halt construction of an almost completed project. Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday,the company saidit would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.""The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped,"" he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.""In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts. This will, by all accounts, increase the capital raising requirement to significantly more than DKK 60 billion,"" Pedersen said.He that the company's Monday announcement to push ahead with its rights issue plans suggested it did not expect the worst-case outcome and was expecting its 60 billion Danish kroner target to be sufficient.""Orsted's assessment of this is positive - but it is no guarantee that it will end up like this,"" Pedersen said.",-0.9398999810218812,99.24,99.24,0.0,SELL,,
TGT,"BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 — up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. “Ethereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,"" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. ""In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally."" SignalPlus’s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: “ETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally."" Analysts say the rally isn’t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street’s preferred blockchain. “Ether’s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

TGT," Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, “early-bird discounts” for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They “are offering a smorgasbord of discounts”, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were “facing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts”. The industry’s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE’s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. “There are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don’t know how else to say it,” said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms’ inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry’s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. “After three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,” said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. “The investors really want their money back.” Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump’s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. “That acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,” said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump’s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump’s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector’s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about €17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly €8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking €5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to €3bn-€4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about €4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. “Right now it’s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven’t seen before,” said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added. “All the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,” she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. “[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,” Joseph at Rede Partners said. “The biggest thing that they’re really looking at is [whether] this manager . . . [is] fit for the future.”",-0.964299976825714,99.24,99.24,0.0,SELL,,

WELL,"Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. ""Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,"" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

WELL," Julie Steinberg,Josh SperoandGeorge Parkerin London PublishedAugust 25 2025 Simply sign up to theUK taxmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. “The uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,” said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. “There’s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.” Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: “I’ve got one British expat client who’s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.” Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: “If you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.” “Non-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn’t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,” he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE’s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. “One said they’ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it’s changed, and it’s got a lot busier,” Kelly said. The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between £4mn and £6.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby’s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested £245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just £25mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: “The UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.” Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai",-0.935100018978118,164.39,164.39,0.0,SELL,,

TGT," Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent PublishedAugust 27 2025 UpdatedAugust 27 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world Denmark has summoned the top US diplomat in the country over reports that American citizens with alleged links to President Donald Trump have been conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, said on Wednesday that there were “foreign actors” attempting to influence the future ofGreenlandand that all such efforts were “unacceptable”. He has summoned Mark Stroh, the chargé d’affaires at the US embassy in Copenhagen and its most senior diplomat inDenmarkat present, for a meeting at the foreign ministry. Denmark has been shaken by Trump’s repeated suggestions that the US wants totake control of the vast Arctic island— a semi-autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark — from Copenhagen, and his refusal to rule out using force to do so. The Scandinavian country had already summoned the top US diplomat in May, following a report in the Wall Street Journal that a classified message wassent to American intelligence agenciesurging them to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who support Trump’s ambition to take over the island. The latest report by DR, the Danish public broadcaster, said Danish authorities were aware of at least three US citizens with alleged links to the Trump administration gathering information in Greenland and conducting influence operations. Rasmussen said in television interviews that he was “not surprised” by the report. But he added: “It’s important that we gain some insight into this so that our people — in both Greenland and Denmark — know what it is that we risk being up against.” Denmark’s security and intelligence service (PET) said on Wednesday that its assessment was that “Greenland, especially in the current situation, is the target of influence campaigns of various kinds. PET expects that such campaigns have the purpose of creating a split in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.” Some senior Danish officials sought to downplay the significance of summoning Stroh, saying that the three US citizens appeared to act in an amateur way and there was no link established to US intelligence. Recommended But Danish politicians reacted with dismay. “This means the whole misery over Greenland is not over,” former foreign minister Martin Lidegaard told the TV channel TV2. He added: “This is putting a heavy strain on our relationship with the US — and Americans should know that too.” Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark’s parliament, said: “It is beyond a joke that they try to infiltrate Greenland’s society in this way. It is Greenland itself who must decide what we want and what future we want.” The allegations come just days after the Trump administration caused pain to Danish business by issuing a stop-work order on an almost complete offshore wind farm co-owned by Ørsted. That came on the same day that Rasmussen and Denmark’s ambassador to the US signed a partnership with California’s Governor Gavin Newsom, the self-styled leader of the resistance to Trump. Danish officials deny there is a connection between the two events. The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The US is currently without an ambassador in Copenhagen despite Trump naming Ken Howery, who is close to Elon Musk, in December. In a separate move, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Wednesday apologised to the thousands of Greenlandic women who over decades were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils. She acknowledged that the case had caused “anger and sorrow” in Greenland as well as hurting perceptions of Denmark. “We cannot change what has happened. But we can take responsibility. Therefore, on behalf of Denmark, I would like to say: sorry.” Many Greenlanders use this issue to express why they want to gain independence from Denmark, but surveys suggest the 57,000 on the Arctic island are reluctant to do so imminently for fear of losing out economically.",-0.87389999628067,96.11,96.11,0.0,SELL,,
COST,"Americans are becomingless confidentabout their financial futures — except for those without children, according to arecent LendingTree surveyof 2,000 U.S. adults.Among adults who don't currentlyconsider themselves wealthy, optimism about becoming wealthy slipped across nearly every demographic LendingTree measured between 2023 and 2025, including age, gender, income and parental status.Parents of children 18 or older reported the steepest decline, down nine percentage points. Parents with kids under 18 saw a five-point drop.The lone exception was child-free Americans, with 42% optimistic in 2025 about becoming wealthy, up from 41% in 2023. That bucks the overall trend, as just 38% of Americans who don't currently see themselves as wealthy believe they ever will be, down from41% in 2023. For parents, finding room in the budget forchild-related expenseshas gotten harder. It costs around $30,000 annually to raise a child young enough to require full-time day care — up 36% since 2023,according to a separate LendingTree study. That figure includes the cost of day care, extra rent, food, clothing, transportation and health insurance, although prices can vary widely by location.Not every family faces all of these costs, of course. Some rely on relatives instead of formal child care, while others already live in larger homes or have fixed housing or transportation costs that don't change much when they have children.Even so, the increase has been dramatic. Nationally, day-care costs alone jumped by an average of 52% since 2023, largely due to inflation, higher wages for child-care workers and a shortage of providers, LendingTree says. Families now spend about 23% of their income on child-related expenses, according to the study.""Most Americans are on a budget and don't have a ton of wiggle room,"" Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst, wrote in a blog post on the study. ""When a big cost like child care shoots up by 40%-plus, it can be a real crisis.""Child-free Americans, by contrast, may be feeling less financial pressure, giving them more freedom to save and invest. Couples without children had a median net worth of $398,960 in 2022, compared with $250,620 for couples raising children, according to theFederal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.Manyare aware of that divide, with three-quarters of adults under 50 tellingPew Research Centerlast year that not having kids makes it easier to save for the future.Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course,How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon posted record profit in the first half of the year underscoring how local challengers toNvidiaare gaining traction as Beijing looks to boost its domestic industry.Cambricon is among a plethora of companies in Chinathat are vying to be an alternative to American giant Nvidia when it comes to providing the chips required to train and run artificial intelligence applications and models.In the first half of the year, Cambricon said revenue surged more than 4,000% year-on-year to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million) and net profit hit a record 1.04 billion yuan. The numbers remain small when compared to Nvidia whichreported $44 billion of revenuein its February to April quarter. The tech giant is due to report itsfiscal second-quarter earningslater today.Still, Cambricon's surge in revenue highlights how tech companies in China are searching for potential alternatives to Nvidia, given the continuous threat that they could be cut off from American technology.Nvidia wasblocked earlier this yearfrom selling its pared back H20 chip to China. It has since been allowed to resume exports to China but must share15% of its revenuefrom sales to the country with the U.S government.Meanwhile, China hasreportedly been discouraginglocal firms to buy Nvidia's H20 chips. Chinese tech giantshave been using local chipsas well as the Nvidia hardware they have been able to get their hands on, which is helping companies like Cambricon.Shares of Cambricon have more than doubled this year and it has added north of $40 billion to its market capitalization, according to S&P Capital IQ. The total value of the company is around $80 billion.Nvidia's strength has not only been in its hardware but also in its software which developers have become accustomed to using. Cambricon said Wednesday that it too is improving its software offering and is working on next-generation hardware.Nevertheless, China's Nvidia rivals face many obstacles when it comes to beating the competition.

TGT,"Hut 8(HUT)is set to spin out most of its bitcoinBTC$111,161.25mining operations into American Bitcoin(ABTC)within the next week, a move that Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said could re-rate the company’s shares. Yesterday, Hut 8 unveiled plans todevelop 1.53 gigawatts(GW)of new capacity across four U.S. sites, in Louisiana, Texas and Illinois, more than doubling its power under management to 2.55 GW. Palmer raised Hut 8's price target to $36 from $33 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock. The new price target suggests nearly 40% upside from yesterday's close just below $26. Palmer noted the update was significant because it showed a clear path to monetizing Hut 8’s energy pipeline, with the company already securing land and power agreements, building infrastructure and negotiating with potential customers. By separating its mining operations into ABTC, Hut 8 aims to position itself as an energy infrastructure pure-play, giving it better access to cheaper project financing by avoiding the volatility tied to bitcoin revenues, the analyst said. The company has up to $2.4 billion in liquidity to support the expansion, including $1.2 billion in bitcoin, $330 million in credit facilities and a $1 billion equity program, the report noted.

Since the start of 2024, LTHs(defined as investors who have held bitcoin for at least 155 days)have realized 3.27 million BTC in profits. This figure has now surpassed the 2021 bull run(just over 3 million BTC)and is far ahead of the 2013 cycle. However, it still trails the 2017 bull run, when realized profits reached 3.93 million BTC. For context, bitcoin’s average price was around $1,000 in 2015, compared with today’s levels which are roughly 100 times higher. This highlights that the market has absorbed a significantly larger dollar value of realized profits.

The sanctions are the latest action taken by the U.S. Treasury in recent months aimed at combating North Korean government workers from seeking employment at American companies using fake identities and documents to apply for jobs. Once employed, the hackers earn a wage from the company, but also steal sensitive company data and extort their employers by demanding a ransom. Ina statement Wednesday, the Treasury said the fraud network generated at least $1 million in profits for the North Korean regime, one of many such schemes that havehelped raise billions of dollars in stolen funds, including cryptocurrency, to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program. As part of its latest round of enforcement, the Treasury sanctioned Vitaliy Sergeyevich Andreyev, a Russian national accused of working with the North Koreans to facilitate payments to a company called Chinyong. The Treasury, whichsanctioned Chinyong in 2024, says the company employs delegations of fraudulent IT workers based in Russia and Laos. The U.S. says Andreyev worked with a North Korean consular official based in Russia called Kim Ung Sun to launder close to $600,000 in stolen money into cryptocurrency for the regime. The Treasury sanctioned Shenyang Geumpungri, a Chinese company that the U.S. says also employs fraudulent IT workers on behalf of the North Korean government, as well as Sinjin, another North Korean front company for the IT workers’ scheme. This is the latest round of sanctions targeting North Korea, as wellas the U.S.-based facilitatorswho help supportthe North Korean’s sprawling money-stealing schemes. North Korea remains highly dedicated to stealing money and converting it into cryptocurrency to skirt the country’s ban on accessing the global financial system. While the scheme is not new, North Koreans are increasingly effective at getting jobs at U.S. and other Western companies. Security researchers in the past couple of years began raising the alarm about the North Korean IT workers’ schemes. Security firm CrowdStrike says North Korean hackers haveinfiltrated hundreds of companies in the United Statesalone by using fake documentation and deception techniques to gain employment. The new sanctions mean U.S. companies, or any company doing business with a U.S. company, are barred from transacting or working with those listed by the Treasury. In practice, the Treasury rulesput the legal responsibilityon hiring companies to ensure they are not hiring North Koreans or other sanctioned individuals by mistake.

MSFT,"Nvidia beat on earnings and revenue for the quarter and issued guidance for the current period that topped estimates.The stock slid in extended trading as data center revenue came of short of expectations.Nvidia said there were no sales of H20 processors to China-based customers in the period, but the company benefited from the release of $180 million worth of inventory to a client outside of China. Nvidiareported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%, signaling to Wall Street that demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure shows no sign of fading.The stock, which is up 35% this year after almost tripling in 2024, slipped in extended trading as data center revenue came up short of estimates for the second straight period.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share:  $1.05 adjusted vs. $1.01 estimatedRevenue: $46.74 billion vs. $46.06 billion estimatedNvidiasaidit expects revenue this quarter to be $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, though that number does not assume any H20 shipments to China. Analysts were expecting revenue of $53.1 billion, according to LSEG.The company's 2026 second quarter results confirmed that Nvidia's data center business remains entrenched in the global AI buildout. Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress told analysts on an earnings call that the company expects between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade.Overall company revenue rose 56% in the quarter from $30.04 billion a year ago, Nvidia said. Year-over-year revenue has now exceeded 50% for nine straight quarters, dating back to mid-2023, when the generative AI boom started to show up in Nvidia's results. However, the second quarter marked Nvidia's slowest period of growth during that stretch.During the quarter, after CEO Jensen Huang's meeting withPresident Donald Trump, Nvidia signaled that it expected to get U.S. licenses to ship the H20 chip to China. The processor, which was custom built for sales to China,costNvidia $4.5 billion in writedowns and could have added $8 billion in second-quarter sales if it had been commercially available during the period, the company previously said.Nvidia said it sold no H20 chips to China during the quarter, bu benefited from the release of $180 million worth of H20 inventory to a customer outside of China. Kress said that Nvidia could ship between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue during the quarter if the geopolitical environment permits.Net income increased 59% to $26.42 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Nvidia's growth is driven by its data center business, centered around graphics processors, or GPUs, and complimentary products for connecting and using them in large quantities. Revenue in the division rose 56% from the year-ago period to $41.1 billion, which was short of a StreetAccount estimate of $41.34 billion in the quarter.Kress said in a statement that $33.8 billion of Nvidia's data center sales were for ""compute,"" or Nvidia's GPU chips, which declined 1% from the first quarter because of $4.0 billion less in H20 sales. Kress said $7.3 billion of data center sales were from networking parts needed to build Nvidia's more complicated systems, which was nearly double the amount from the year-ago period.

MSFT,"Nvidia beat on earnings and revenue for the quarter and issued guidance for the current period that topped estimates.The stock slid in extended trading as data center revenue came of short of expectations.Nvidia said there were no sales of H20 processors to China-based customers in the period, but the company benefited from the release of $180 million worth of inventory to a client outside of China. Nvidiareported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%, signaling to Wall Street that demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure shows no sign of fading.The stock, which is up 35% this year after almost tripling in 2024, slipped in extended trading as data center revenue came up short of estimates for the second straight period.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share:  $1.05 adjusted vs. $1.01 estimatedRevenue: $46.74 billion vs. $46.06 billion estimatedNvidiasaidit expects revenue this quarter to be $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, though that number does not assume any H20 shipments to China. Analysts were expecting revenue of $53.1 billion, according to LSEG.The company's 2026 second quarter results confirmed that Nvidia's data center business remains entrenched in the global AI buildout. Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress told analysts on an earnings call that the company expects between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade.Overall company revenue rose 56% in the quarter from $30.04 billion a year ago, Nvidia said. Year-over-year revenue has now exceeded 50% for nine straight quarters, dating back to mid-2023, when the generative AI boom started to show up in Nvidia's results. However, the second quarter marked Nvidia's slowest period of growth during that stretch.During the quarter, after CEO Jensen Huang's meeting withPresident Donald Trump, Nvidia signaled that it expected to get U.S. licenses to ship the H20 chip to China. The processor, which was custom built for sales to China,costNvidia $4.5 billion in writedowns and could have added $8 billion in second-quarter sales if it had been commercially available during the period, the company previously said.Nvidia said it sold no H20 chips to China during the quarter, bu benefited from the release of $180 million worth of H20 inventory to a customer outside of China. Kress said that Nvidia could ship between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue during the quarter if the geopolitical environment permits.Net income increased 59% to $26.42 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Nvidia's growth is driven by its data center business, centered around graphics processors, or GPUs, and complimentary products for connecting and using them in large quantities. Revenue in the division rose 56% from the year-ago period to $41.1 billion, which was short of a StreetAccount estimate of $41.34 billion in the quarter.Kress said in a statement that $33.8 billion of Nvidia's data center sales were for ""compute,"" or Nvidia's GPU chips, which declined 1% from the first quarter because of $4.0 billion less in H20 sales. Kress said $7.3 billion of data center sales were from networking parts needed to build Nvidia's more complicated systems, which was nearly double the amount from the year-ago period.

NVDA,"Solana's SOL outperformed the broader crypto market on Wednesday, climbing 7.68% in 24 hours to trade at $208.24,according to CoinDesk Data. By comparison, theCoinDesk 20 Index(CD20)rose 2.89% and the total crypto market cap gained just 1.6% during the same period. Analysts said Solana’s strong performance reflects a combination of technical momentum and structural demand. Scott Melker, a trader known as the “Wolf of All Streets,”arguedthat Solana is now at a critical level against bitcoin. He said a breakout here could make SOL the “darling” of the next altcoin cycle. His chart showed SOL pressing into resistance against BTC, a pairing that often signals whether a token can outperform the broader market. Another analyst, Lark Davis, was more direct, calling Solana the “catch-up trade” for investors who missed ether’s(ETH)breakout from $1,400 during the last cycle. Daviscitedthree drivers: the rise of SOL-based treasury companies modeled on bitcoin accumulation firms, the prospect of a spot SOL ETF getting approved in the near future by the U.S. SEC and growing institutional interest. These factors could push billions of dollars into SOL, he noted. However, Altcoin Sherpa, another widely followed analyst on X,cautionedagainst chasing the rally. He described SOL's strength as unusual but advised traders to consider taking profits between $205 and $215 or waiting for more clarity before entering. His view reflects the risk that weekend or short-term rallies often retrace once liquidity normalizes. Meanwhile, DeFi asset management firm Sentoraaddedanother perspective, noting that more than $820 million in SOL is already held in corporate treasuries. The number is worth noting as ETH treasury holdings stood at a similar level in April before expanding to nearly $20 billion. The firm said that the SOL corporate holding trajectory suggests the token could follow a similar path if adoption accelerates. Adding to the positive sentiments of some analysts, Solana is also seeing institutional adoption grow. Earlier today, staking service provider Chorus Oneannouncedthe launch of a new Solana validator in partnership with Delphi Consulting, part of Delphi Digital. The firms said the move reflects a belief that institutions should contribute not just capital but also infrastructure to the networks they back. Chorus One described the validator as institutional-grade infrastructure, positioning it as part of Solana’s growing base of serious, long-term participants.

NVDA,"The native token of Hyperliquid(HYPE)surged to a fresh all-time high early Wednesday, continuing its meteoric climb this year as the decentralized exchange best known for on-chain perpetual trading has attracted record activity. The token broke through the $50 mark for the first time, gaining about 8% in the past 24 hours. HYPE is now up 430% since its April nadir and up roughly 15x since it began trading in late November at around $3. The rally has been fueled by record trading activity across the exchange and its automated buyback mechanism, which steadily absorbs tokens from the market and reduces circulating supply. Read more:Hyperliquid Now Dominates DeFi Derivatives, Processing $30B a Day The decentralized exchange recorded more than $357 billion in derivatives volume in August, according toDefiLlamadata, up from $319 billion in July and nearly ten times higher than a year ago. Spot trading volumes also set a record, surpassing $3 billion for the week ending Aug. 24,Blockworksdata shows. These flows translated into a windfall for the protocol. Hyperliquid booked $105 million in trading fees during August, the highest this year, per DefiLlama data. Much of those earnings are funneled directly into purchasing HYPE on the market through Hyperliquid's Assistance Fund. The facility is an automated on-chain mechanism that buys back tokens on the open market, creating sustained buy pressure for HYPE and effectively reducing the circulating supply. Since its launch in January, the fund’s holdings ballooned from 3 million tokens to 29.8 million HYPE, now worth over $1.5 billion, fueling the token's rally. On the news front, digital asset custodian BitGoadded supporton Tuesday for the HyperEVM network, which underpins the Hyperliquid ecosystem, unlocking institutional access to HYPE and related applications. In a recent research note, ByteTree analysts Shehriyar Ali and Charlie Morris described Hyperliquid as a ""powerhouse"" that has become the largest decentralized perpetual futures venue. ""All things considered, HyperLiquid is among the most compelling protocols in DeFi today,"" they wrote. ""Its strong fundamentals, record-breaking fee generation and dominant market share make it impossible to ignore."" Despite the bullish fundamentals, the report also flagged concerns about the token's valuation. HYPE currently trades at a fully diluted valuation(FDV)of over $50 billion, with only about third of supply in circulation with a 16.8 billion market capitalization.

Between Aug. 26 at 15:00 and Aug. 27 at 14:00, the cryptocurrency moved within a $0.017 band – about 4% – from a high of $0.40 to a low of $0.38. After briefly testing resistance at $0.40 late on Aug. 26, XLM retraced to $0.39, a 2% dip from session openings, as sellers dominated overnight trading. Volumes ran above average at more than 45 million tokens exchanged, a sign that institutional activity remained elevated despite the pullback. The spike in trading coincided with broader regulatory developments. Daily turnover surged 115% to $402.21 million when XLM touched $0.40, underscoring how institutional engagement has intensified alongside anticipation for possible approvals of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. Recent filings for funds tied to domestically developed digital assets, including Stellar, have helped draw corporate and institutional money into the space even as policymakers weigh tighter oversight. Intraday action on Aug. 27 offered a snapshot of that dynamic. Between 13:20 and 14:19, XLM climbed from $0.38 to $0.39, gaining about 1% in under an hour before consolidating.

PGR," Joe Millerin Washington PublishedAugust 27 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has called for billionaire progressive donor George Soros to face racketeering and corruption charges for supposedly supporting “violent protests” across the US. In a post on his social media platform on Wednesday, Trump claimed the 95-year-oldSorosand his “radical left” son Alex, who leads the family’s philanthropic foundation, “should be charged with RICO”, referring to a statute usually used to combat organised crime. “We’re not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more, never giving it so much as a chance to ‘BREATHE,’ and be FREE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Soros, and his group of psychopaths, have caused great damage to our Country!” he added. “That includes his Crazy, West Coast friends. Be careful, we’re watching you!” The broadside came after reports in right-leaning news outlets claimed this month thatOpen Society Foundations, which distributes grants on Soros’s behalf to progressive causes, was funding protests, especially against the Trump administration’s deployment of troops in Washington DC. A spokesperson for OSF said of Trump’s comments: “These accusations are outrageous and false. The Open Society Foundations do not support or fund violent protests. Our mission is to advance human rights, justice and democratic principles at home and around the world.” The tirade against Soros — a Jewish holocaust survivor and frequent target of the Maga right — is the latest attempt by Trump to intimidate political foes with the threat of legal action. In the past few months, Trump has repeatedly threatened to prosecute or jail politicians, including his former presidential rival Kamala Harris and New York Democratic mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani. He has ordered an investigation into former president Joe Biden and his aides, and suggested a criminal probe into Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and one-time ally. Last week, the FBIraided the home of John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump who has emerged as a strong critic of the president’s foreign policy. Recommended Trump has long reserved some of his sharpest ire for the Soros family, who were among the largest donors to the Harris campaign, spending more than $85mn in the 2024 election cycle. During his criminal trial in New York last year, Trump constantly highlighted that district attorney Alvin Bragg had been backed by Soros. Trump himself faced Rico charges by state prosecutors in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The case stalled after the original prosecutor was removed by a higher court. Trump’s threat on Wednesday garnered support from Elon Musk, who posted that it was “high time action was taken against Soros directly”.

COIN,"Stellar’s native token, Lumens(XLM), showed sharp intraday volatility over the past 24 hours, with prices fluctuating between $0.38 and $0.39 — a 3% swing. After sliding from $0.39 to $0.38 on the evening of Aug. 27, XLM found firm support at the lower bound, where trading volumes surged above the daily average of 25.4 million. The bounce set the stage for a steady recovery through overnight sessions, allowing the asset to reclaim resistance at $0.38 and close near session highs. Market analysts interpret the move as a sign of renewed institutional accumulation, pointing to a possible recovery trajectory. The uptick in activity reflects what industry observers see as growing confidence among corporate treasurers seeking faster, cheaper settlement rails. Data shows institutional trading in Stellar rose 39% above average, reinforcing its appeal as companies navigate increasingly complex global commerce. The final trading hour on Aug. 28 highlighted that momentum, with XLM climbing from $0.38 to $0.39 in under an hour. Analysts note that the move coincided with heightened interest from corporate treasury desks exploring decentralized settlement protocols.

NWSA,"Polkadot's DOT earlier Thurwday rose more than 2%, with institutional volume patterns suggesting professional participation, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The model showed the digital asset demonstrating textbook institutional accumulation behavior, initially testing support at $3.81 before executing a measured advance to $4.02 accompanied by substantial volume of 4.6 million units. Trading volumes exceeding 320,000 units during the initial decline phase indicate institutional repositioning rather than retail panic, with subsequent buying interest establishing clear support levels around $3.90-$3.91, according to the model. The move higher in Polkadot reversed though, with the price slipping back to that $3.90 support.

TGT,"Internet Computer Protocol(ICP)demonstrated resilience during the last 24 hours, staging a rally thatlifted the token nearly 3% to $5.13. The move capped a V-shaped recovery that began with an overnight retreat to support levels around $4.98, where a high volume of buying activity took hold, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. After dipping from $5.07, ICP consolidated within the $4.98-$5.00 zone, establishing a base reinforced by trading volume of 372,179 units, substantially above average levels. This accumulation phase marked the turning point, as buying pressure mounted through the early session. Momentum built steadily before culminating in a decisive breakout late in the period. ICP rose through multiple resistance barriers to touch $5.13, with the final advance fueled by a 272,186-unit volume spike. Resistance that had previously formed near $5.11 was breached, suggesting sellers were losing control of the near-term trend. Cryptocurrencies such as ICP appear to be drawing fresh interest as alternative asset classes gain traction. The recovery and heavy accumulation at support levels may position ICP for further gains, with the next technical target in sight around $5.18 based onFibonacci extension levels.

WELL," Robert Shrimsley PublishedAugust 28 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Coming soon from the people who brought you Brexit — mass deportations, withdrawal from human rights treaties and Trumpist assaults on the judiciary. What could possibly go wrong? As then, immigration is the tip of the spear designed to put Nigel Farage’s Reform UK into power and take EU departure to its ideological conclusions. Brexit: the sequel is being skilfully and shamefully whipped up by him and his media cheerleaders. The populist right seems to be willing on conflict and unrest as it fuels the immigration and asylum panic, demonising every non-white arrival as a predatory sex offender. Signs of defiance now include the painting of St George’s crosses on mini-roundabouts and hanging flags from lampposts. Farage’s latest pledgesinvolve sweeping but merciless promises, imprecise details, a vow to repeal Britain’s human rights laws and that usefully opaque term, “mass deportations”. Even so, the impact of his summer campaign has left centrists warning against dancing to Farage’s tune. They argue that talk of an eruption of protests outside asylum hotels has so far turned out to be mostly only a few hundred people. Above all, liberals urge Keir Starmer to fight back against the dehumanising rhetoric of the right. For those who recoil from the right’s tactics, these are seductive arguments. Scorn is a comforting reflex. But this is where Brexit memories are instructive because we have seen this movie before. The past decade was a masterclass in how to misread a nation. For when majorities are telling pollsters that the issue is their main concern, the battle has to be fought where it is, not where you wish it to be. Like it or not, the belief thatmass immigration has gone too far,that control has been lost and that integration is failing is now a mainstream opinion. Most telling is that a major political party now feels safe deploying the term “mass deportations”, a phrase Farage was once nervous of using and which to the chagrin of some supporters, he insists applies only to those here unlawfully, even though his campaigns often conflate them with legal migrants. His new confidence, perhaps boosted by Donald Trump’s example, signals how far the boundaries of political debate have shifted.Two former Labour home secretarieshave even joined the calls for the suspension or “decoupling” from the European Convention on Human Rights to speed deportations. The flags are also instructive. Unlike Americans, Brits have traditionally worn their patriotism lightly and rarely felt the need for performative flag displays. So, as with the one place where the union jack is most often flown — Northern Ireland — these displays are less signs of patriotism than insecurity, of communities feeling threatened and ill at ease. A corrosive narrative of a British way of life being lost in the volume of mass immigration is taking root well beyond Farage’s fan base. Centrists may deplore the malign efforts to stir up trouble outside asylum hotels but they also know that few ordinary voters want one near their home. This feeling will not be beaten back by political attacks and statistics. National data will never trumppeople’s own sense of how things are. In fact, Labour has had some success. Legal migration is now coming down rapidly anddeportations have risen significantly,but as long as the small boats keep coming and the asylum hotels stay open, it will not wrest the agenda back from Farage. Nor does salvation lie in repeating the old Brexit mistakes. Denouncing Farage’s policies as too hardline or unworkable simply reinforces the sense that his is the only party that is truly serious about the issue. And this further boosts his appeal as a leader prepared to do tough things to address other failures of the state. In any case, such attacks carry less weight when coming from parties whose own immigration pledges have proved largely worthless. Above all, you can’t lead a fightback if people are not listening to you. Polls show voters are already dismissing Starmer. If the prime minister does not want to gift Britain to Reform, Labour needs to neutralise the issue. This means looking both effective and tough. Despite some successes, so far it has failed to convince. Although open to seeking reform of the ECHR, Starmer argues it is not the core problem. He believes most problems can be solved domestically with reforms to immigration tribunals,moves to speed up asylum appeals,where waits are currently 53 weeks, and legislation to narrow the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the “right to a family life” and often frustrates deportations. Labour also needs a new deterrent to asylum seekers who rightly calculate that they have a good chance of staying if they get here. But having scrapped the Tories’ Rwanda processing scheme, Labour has yet to find an offshore alternative. There will also need to be a hard-headed look at policies to promote integration among legal migrants. But most urgently voters need to see the end of the asylum hotels. A promise to close them all by 2029 is far too late. There is a fight Labour can take to Farage; that Mr Brexit is stirring up division with an agenda to deliver a Trumpist Britain. But voters will not listen until they see their concerns addressed. This is the hard politics of the moment. Winners do what it takes and right now a floundering Starmer is losing the second battle of Brexit. robert.shrimsley@ft.com",-0.7439000010490411,167.39,167.39,0.0,SELL,,
XYZ," Claire Jonesin Washington PublishedAugust 28 2025 UpdatedAugust 28 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump’s move to fire her, kicking off a landmark legal battle with sweeping implications for the independence of the world’s leading central bank. Cook on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the US president in federal court in Washington, alleging Trump’s actions infringed on her constitutional rights and US law. The suit came after Trump said on Monday thathe was sacking herimmediately over claims she lied on mortgage applications. “This case challenges President Trump’s unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would the first of its kind in the Board’s history,” the lawsuit said. It added that “the operational independence of the Federal Reserve is vital to its ability to make sound economic decisions, free from the political pressures of an election cycle.” The market reaction to Cook’s firing was muted, but many economists, legal scholars and investors noted that Trump’s move marked one of the gravest threats to the Fed since it became independent from government 74 years ago. Her case against the president will also have short-term implications, with upcoming hearings potentially determining whether she can partake in the central bank’s mid-September policy meeting. The case revolves around whether the mortgage fraud allegations made against Cook by Bill Pulte, a Trump ally and the federal housing director, constitute “cause” to fire a Fed governor who was confirmed by Congress. Pulte claims Cook indicated in lending documents that two properties she had purchased within weeks of each other — in Michigan and in Atlanta — were primary residences. Typically mortgages on primary residences come with better terms. The allegations posted online by Pulte date back to 2021, before Cook was nominated by the Biden administration for theFedjob in 2022. Cook is the central bank’s first black woman governor. Her term was set to run until 2038. Recommended Pulte referred his allegations to the justice department, but authorities have not filed any charges against her or accused her of wrongdoing. Cook’s lawsuit said “the claims made in director Pulte’s referral letter are unsubstantiated allegations about conduct that predates her Senate confirmation, and governor Cook has never been given an opportunity to address them”. It argues that Cook’s firing violated the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which established the Fed as the central bank of the US, because it did not prove that there was “cause” to fire her, and because she was deprived of her “statutory right to notice and a hearing”. The suit also says the firing breached Cook’s Fifth Amendment rights to due process because she was removed without “any process whatsoever”. Cook also pre-emptively named the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and chair Jay Powell as defendants, to block them from executing Trump’s dismissal. The Fed has said previously it would abide by court rulings. US district judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, will preside over the case. Legal experts broadly expect the case to ultimately land with the Supreme Court. The White House did not immediately comment on the matter. Trump’s move to fire Cook is the latest attack on the central bank. The president wants US interest rates cut by 3 percentage points from their current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent. His allies have also called for an overhaul of the Fed’s governance structures, including more control of its budget and measures that would make it easier to fire board officials. On Tuesday, Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he had encouraged Fed chair Jay Powell to undertake an internal review before the Trump administration commissioned an external one. “The Fed is an unaccountable institution and its relationship with the American people depends on a high level of trust,” Bessent told Fox Business, adding that incidents such as the allegations against Cook “puncture that trust”. Recommended If Trump’s efforts to fire Cook succeed, it would give him a majority of appointees on the seven-strong Federal Reserve board. All seven members have votes on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee and hold sway over the renewal of the terms of regional Fed presidents, as well as governance of the central bank’s operations. The Fed said on Tuesday it would “abide by any court decision”, which is expected in the coming days.",-0.8669999837875361,80.78,80.78,0.0,SELL,,

That's important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia's overall revenue in the second quarter.""We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,"" Nvidia wrote in the filing.Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.""We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 [cloud service provider] capex expectations,"" wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday.

It's a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.In its filing, Nvidia says it has both ""direct customers"" and ""indirect customers."" Customer A and Customer B are listed as ""direct customers.""Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia's chips. They're companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia's direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia's mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an ""AI research and development company"" contributed a ""meaningful"" amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company's AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and ""neoclouds,"" which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for ""sovereign AI."" All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia's revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.""As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,"" Huang said.WATCH:Nvidia's concentration dependence risk",-0.5608000159263611,231.56,231.56,0.0,SELL,,

They're companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia's direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia's mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an ""AI research and development company"" contributed a ""meaningful"" amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company's AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and ""neoclouds,"" which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for ""sovereign AI."" All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia's revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.""As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,"" Huang said.WATCH:Nvidia's concentration dependence risk",-0.5608000159263611,231.56,229.05,-0.010839523233719,SELL,,

Earlier this month something very weird happened with Cathie Wood’s flagship actively-managed fund, the ARK Innovation ETF. Take a look at this wild chart of its assets under management: The fund (known by its ticker ARKK) mysteriously saw its AUM suddenly balloon from $7.1bn on August 8 to $12.8bn on August 14, before swiftly falling back to $7.2bn on August 20. It’s now resting fairly steady at ca $7.5bn. So what caused this massive and sudden inflation and deflation of ARKK? ETF.comreckonsthat it was a huge “heartbeat trade”, an old trick that ETF managers pull to limit capital gains tax bills. This involves pushing money into an ETF and almost immediately redeeming it in the form of shares, which are then sold. We’re not convinced. The pattern of massive inflows and outflows does look alittlelike an ETF heartbeat trade. But heartbeat trades tend to be two-day things — in and out — not things that happen overseveraldays. The timing is also . . . curious. We’re speculating, but FT Alphaville wonders it was actually a funky and extremely profitable trade related to the initial public offering of the Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish on August 13. On August 4 Bullish revealed in anSEC filingthat BlackRock and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management had each indicated an interest in buying up to $200mn worth of shares in its IPO. On August 11, Bullish said in anew filingit was increasing the size of the offering because of the strong demand. By the end of that Monday, Bloomberg reported that bankers on the deal had stopped taking orders even for the enlarged deal, which was set to begin trading on Wednesday, August 13. Allocations tohot IPOsare often extremely sought after, as a first-day pop can hand investors a quick profit. That is particularly true when the stock is likely to catch the attention of retail investors — such as Bullish’s own users — who usually have no way of acquiring shares in or ahead of the IPO, and have to wait until it begins trading to grab what they can. Even big institutions often struggle to snag the shares they want, and the Bullish IPO was reportedly over 20 times oversubscribed — making any allocation extremely valuable. However, a funky arbitrage at the heart of the ETF mechanism opened up an avenue for someone to stealthily engineer indirect exposure to the Bullish IPO. Most investors that want exposure to an ETF simply buy its shares, just like any stock. But there’s also a process known as “creation and redemptions” that ensures that the value of the ETF constantly reflects the value of its underlying stocks. If the ETF is overvalued you can buy all the cheaper constituents, hand them to a specialised ETF market-maker known as an “authorised participant” and get shares in the ETF. If the ETF is undervalued compared to its holdings, you can ask the authorised participant to redeem your shares for a slice of the underlying holdings, and sell them off. This is what appears to have happened with ARKK in mid-August. Anticipating that the IPO would enjoy a massive pop and hand an immediate windfall for ARKK, it looks like someone quietly spent billions of dollars on shares that replicated ARKK (minus Bullish) to create a whopping 68.8mn shares in the ETF. On Aug 13 — the day of the Bullish IPO — this someone in practice represented about 41 per cent ofallof ARKK’s shares outstanding. That made them by far the biggest owner of ARKK, holding far more of the ETF than the next 10 biggest ownerscombined. That day, ARK also revealed in astandard trade notificationthat it had in fact acquired2.53mn shares in Bullishacross three of its actively-managed ETFs — most of which was parked inside ARKK — at the IPO price of $37. Then, after Bullish had soared 83 per cent to $68 on its first day of trading, the money began to gush out of ARKK again as someone redeemed shares just as aggressively as they had created them. The ETF’s shares outstanding peaked at 166.5mn on August 13, and fell back down to 114.3mn on August 15. Put a bit more simply and succinctly, it looks like someone in practice managed to finagle a large synthetic allocation to the Bullish IPO by aggressively creating shares in ARKK. And once the windfall materialised they immediately redeemed those shares to crystallise the gain, sending ARKK back to earth. How much did they make? This is very back-of-the envelope stuff, but Bullish jumped from the IPO price of $38 to close at $68. ARKK received an allocation of1.714mn Bullish shares,so it made a swift $51.4mn profit on the day of the IPO. Assuming that our mystery trader accounted for all the 68.8mn shares created in the days leading up to the IPO, it means they would have made — very roughly — $21.2mn over a couple of days. Nice. Unfortunately, Alphaville hasn’t been able to find that out. And we should stress again that this is just our theory for what happened. But would probably have to be a very large, sophisticated and daring investor — or possibly a small club of investors. After all, this was not a riskless trade. Although the IPO did look like it would trade well, there was no guarantee that the price would pop the way it did. Indeed, Bullish fell back to a low of $57.9 on August 19, and at pixel time is trading at about $64. That’s obviously still well above its IPO price but down from its first close and the peak of $118 it hit on the first day of trading. And the size of the trade was humongous. ARKK’s assets peaked at $12.83bn on August 14, but by then the share count had already begun to contract, so the best proxy for how much was spent is probably the $2.9bn its assets grew by on Aug 11-12, when share count was ballooning. Moreover, ARKK is a very volatile ETF, so ploughing several billion dollars into it even for a few days is pretty ballsy. A big drop in something like Tesla (over 11 per cent of the fund) could conceivably have wiped out any profits from the Bullish IPO. Plus, it looks like there were similar short-term trades happening in two other smaller ARK ETFs that also got some allocations to the Bullish IPO — the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the ARK Fintech ETF (ARKF). The size and multiple distinct legs of the trade implies that it was someone big, clever, and ballsy doing it. Does all this matter? Well, the main obvious losers from all this were pre-existing ARK investors, whose stakes in Bullish and subsequent windfall from the IPO were diluted. Because of the ETF creation-redemption mechanism, they saw someone barge in to the feast they were about to enjoy, scoff down a lot of the food, chug the wine and then suddenly disappear without even a thank-you. The size and violence of the money flows might also have had a knock-on impact on some of the underlying stocks in ARKK, especially smaller ones where Cathie Wood’s ETF is a particularly large shareholder. We reached out to ARK Invest to get their thoughts but haven’t heard back from them. However, Alphaville is particularly interested in this case because of the ongoingETFisation of marketsand the consequences that flow from that. This ARK-Bullish situation is a pretty unique case — most ETFs are passive funds that don’t partake in IPOs — but as they continue to grow in size and funkiness they are going to leave increasingly large and complex footprints on financial markets. Some people will bemoan that, while others will try to profit from it.",-0.103500001132488,1127.99,1127.99,0.0,SELL,,

COST,"Starting Friday, President Trump's elimination of the de minimis shipping exemption that allowed low-value packages to arrive to the U.S. without trade duties went into effect.These shipments represents 92% of all cargo arriving to the U.S., up to four million packages daily, and the loss of their duty-free status could result in new costs to small to medium-sized businesses estimated as high as $71 billion.""When I think about the de minimis change, the message is clear: tariffs are now universal,"" one customs experts told CNBC. At the stroke of midnight, 92% of all U.S. cargo shipments, and up to 4 million packages daily, lost their duty-free status with President Donald Trump's removal ofthe de minimis exemptionfor low-value trade. Any imported goods sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 will now be subject to applicable duties. While the winners and losers onthe retail landscapeandamong consumersare debated, customs experts are warning the troubles facing small to medium-sized businesses that relied on the duty-free exemption are just beginning, and will be significant.""When I think about the de minimis change, the message is clear: tariffs are now universal, regardless of value,"" said Nunzio De Filippis, licensed customs broker and co-CEO of CargoTrans. ""Every package counts. That's a major change in how global e-commerce has operated for the last decade.""The postal carrier or ""qualified party"" (e.g., USPS, Royal Mail, La Poste) that decides how duties are collected on packages moving through the postal stream must collect those duties from shippers or recipients and remit them to U.S. Customs.The carriers have two methods to choose from — either a percentage of the country's tariff rate (ad valorem) or a flat per-package fee, De Filippis explained. With the flat rate, there are three tiers: $80 if the IEEPA tariff rate — the trade duties put into effect by Trump using emergency economic powers — is under 16% (such as EU goods at 15%); $160 if it's between 16% and 25% (such as Vietnam at 20%); and $200 if it's above 25% (such as India at 50% or China at 30%). After a six-month transition period, the flat fee option goes away and all packages will be subject to the percentage tariff rate only.According to Marianne Rowden, trade attorney and CEO of the E-Merchants Trade Council, which represents e-sellers and companies that support e-commerce, the total increase in cost to be paid by small and medium-sized businesses may reach over $71 billion, calculations that she said are based on an average value per package of $48 and data from the U.S Customs and Border Protection for fiscal year 2025.Availability of air freight for U.S. shippers will also change.The number of government postal officesshutting the door on shipmentsbound for the U.S. has grown to includeSwiss Post, Japan Postand postal services in Australia, India, New Zealand, the U.K. and other parts of Europe that announced they are suspending shipments.Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany, both divisions of DHL, stopped U.S.-bound shipments on August 25.""For shippers, this brings increased costs, complexity, and the need to adapt shipping setups to comply with new customs requirements. They may also face longer processing times and additional administrative steps when importing lower-value goods,"" said Andrew Williams, CEO for DHL Express Americas, who told CNBC it will continue to process inbound shipments to the United States in accordance with the applicable customs rules and regulations. ""Our main priority remains to protect our core service commitment to customers and to minimize any disruption that arises from changes in tariff and trade policy, while remaining compliant with applicable customs rules and regulations,"" Williams said.Ryan Elliott, chief operating officer at Everstream Analytics, said these global postal changes may catch smaller businesses by surprise. ""We've already seen a number of countries, especially in the EU, pause deliveries to the U.S., explaining that they need more time to work through how they'll collect and transit duties and data,"" said Elliott. ""Small businesses may not be aware of the changes, and many will be caught off guard. But, when the dust settles, my best guess is that many will struggle to comply as they simply don't have the resources to manage through customs requirements,"" he said.Josh Teitelbaum, an international trade expert at Akin and former U.S. Commerce official, said the way this new tariff change is being implemented is leading to global confusion. ""With many of the world's postal services temporarily suspending service to the U.S., ultimately, consumers and small businesses will be the ones that see increased costs or shipping delays as we undergo more changes to trade policy,"" he said.Ronald Kleijwegt, CEO at Vinturas, a global supply chain collaboration network serving global manufacturers and OEMs like Mitsubishi and The Association of European Vehicle Logistics, said small businesses will feel the most pain. ""What was once a straightforward cross-border trade is now full of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Larger companies may have the resources to adapt by absorbing costs, rerouting logistics, or investing in compliance. Smaller businesses often do not, which can limit their opportunities, slow innovation, and reduce consumer choice.""Concerns about the financial health of small businesses are growing. Jacob Bennett, co-founder of small business banking consultant Crux Analytics, said the conversations it is having with banks and credit unions are about the impact of the trade volatility on U.S. small businesses. ""We are trying to help them navigate all of these changes,"" said Bennett. ""So many small and medium-sized businesses operate on such thin margins and don't have the pools of capital that they can fall back on and extend their runway, so many small businesses will unfortunately suffer because of these changes.""In itsexplanation for the de minimis elimination, the White House has stressed that over the past decade, the volume of de minimis shipments to the United States exploded, growing from 134 million shipments in 2015 to over 1.36 billion shipments in 2024. Low-cost Asian retail e-commerce companies have been among the major beneficiaries of that boom,such as Shein and Temu. In addition, the Trump administration says de minimis shipments accounted for 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal year 2024. ""These shipments often broke the law, with 98% of narcotics seized from cargo falling under the de minimis exemption, as well as 97% of counterfeit items seized,"" it stated in a document on the new trade policy.But for small businesses, the primary fear is that the additional duties will eat into their already thin margins and potentially force them to raise prices.Shippers that have leveraged de minimis will not have all of the tariff mitigation strategies available that bulk importers have, according to Brian Bourke,chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics, and he says its elimination will create two likely impacts for consumers: higher prices and less reliable delivery. Bourke said businesses will likely pass on new duty costs for the low-value goods that transit into the United States, and the increased data requirements for the postal channels may lead to delays depending on how the other countries' postal operators are able to handle and manage these new requirements.""Large businesses that rely on small businesses should immediately get to work figuring out which suppliers they rely on for what and do what they can to either help them comply or find alternative suppliers,"" said Elliott.Ultimately, the impact of the end of the de minimis exemption will extend beyond U.S. businesses, according to Kleijwegt. ""With de minimis scrapped, EU exporters now face tariffs on low-value items, added customs paperwork, and higher shipping costs when selling to the US. U.S. small businesses now lose out on cheaper European sourcing, while smaller EU firms lose easy duty-free access, which has huge implications for market access on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said.",-0.7192999720573421,943.56,943.56,0.0,SELL,,

""Today's in-line PCE Price Index will keep the focus on the jobs market. For now, the odds still favor a September cut.""Given that equities were already under pressure heading into the PCE print, Baird's Ross Mayfield believes the day's pullback has more to do with the market's recent performance. Stocks are coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 closing above the 6,500 mark for the first time Thursday.""The PCE number was fine, but there's a bit of an earnings overhang and maybe just a little profit-taking after hitting an all-time high,"" the firm's investment strategist said in an interview with CNBC.Even with Friday's losses, the indexes closed out August with solid gains. The 30-stock Dow logged a more than 3% advance in August, while the S&P 500 tallied a nearly 2% advance. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has seen an August gain of 1.6%.The market hit new highs into a long weekend and month that has historically been poor for major benchmarks. September was the biggest losing month for the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq since 1950, according to The Stock Trader's Almanac, and the S&P 500 in particular has seen especially weak September performancesover the last 10 years, per Bespoke.

Hello, this is Spriha Srivastava, CNBC International's Executive Editor for Digital, writing from London. This week, I take a closer look at India's tightrope walk — tariffs from Washington, oil from Moscow, and an uneasy handshake with Beijing. Let's dive in. This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribehere.The big storyPicture this: you're at a dinner party with three friends who are struggling to get along. One is picking fights with everyone, another is slipping you secret notes under the table, and the third is that old frenemy you'd rather avoid but can't ignore. Awkward, right?That is where India finds itself. Washington is piling on tariffs, Moscow is keeping India's energy bills in check with cheap oil, and Beijing, despite a bruised relationship, is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi with open arms at the SCO summit in China this week. India's juggling act on the world stage has never looked more complicated, or more consequential.Trade with the U.S. has become a flashpoint. Washington has imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on imports from India, followed by another 25% penalty tied to India's Russian oil purchases. That leaves duties on some Indian exports as high as 50%. The U.S. is India's single largest export market, worth about $87 billion a year, nearly a fifth of its total merchandise trade. Key Indian sectors such as diamonds, garments and seafood are especially exposed.Think of what that means on the ground. Diamond polishers in Gujarat, garment workers in Tirupur, and seafood processors in Kerala all depend on U.S. orders. Electronics and pharma are spared for now, but other sectors — which employ millions — are suddenly exposed.The tariff fight comes even as the two countries deepen strategic ties. On a number of fronts, the U.S. and India are cooperating; the two countries are expanding defense cooperation, for instance, working together in the Quad, and advancing semiconductor supply chain talks.Major U.S. firms, includingApple,Microsoft, andAmazon, have increased their investments in India in recent years. Yet trade frictions complicate the relationship, raising the question in Delhi: does Washington view India as a true partner, or simply another trading problem to manage?Now, let's turn to Russia. India is the world's third-largest oil consumer, burning through more than 5 million barrels a day, so cheap energy isn't a luxury — it's a necessity. In 2021, just 1% of India's crude came from Russia.Today it's more than 35%, around 1.75 million barrels a day, saving Delhi over $17 billion since early 2022,according to analyst estimates. Those discounts have kept inflation in check and given Modi breathing space at home.But there's a second layer here. India is walking a geopolitical tightrope, with Pakistan tensions threatening to boil over. In that context, Russia is a vital security partner and central to India's defense procurement, making it difficult for Delhi to pull away without weakening its security posture.The catch? Washington isn't impressed. U.S. officials including Peter Navarro and Scott Bessent argue Delhi is ""profiteering"" by paying above the G7's $60 price cap on Russian oil and exporting refined fuels back to Europe.Then comes Beijing, which represents perhaps the trickiest relationship of all. Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and stand alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Beijing says the event is a display of solidarity, tensions between India and China remain unresolved.Border clashes in 2020 killed at least 20 Indian soldiers, prompting a freeze in high-level engagement. Since then, India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, tightened foreign investment rules, and promoted self-reliance in key sectors. Yet trade between the two countries still hit $118 billion last year, with India importing far more than it exports. This imbalance frustrates Delhi but also underscores why cutting ties is not realistic.Analysts say Modi is unlikely to secure a major breakthrough when he visits Tianjin. But showing up is a signal in itself — that India is willing to keep lines of communication open, even while deepening defense ties with Washington and buying cheap oil from Moscow.Step back, and India's position looks clearer. The U.S. is its biggest customer but also its harshest critic. Russia keeps the lights on, but at a political cost. China is the rival next door, yet too big to ignore. Delhi calls its approach ""strategic autonomy."" It has worked for decades, but today the balancing act is under more pressure than ever.Which brings us back to that dinner party. India wants all three guests to remain seated, however awkward the conversation may be. The real test is whether Modi can stop someone from banging the table, throwing down their fork, and storming out.Top TV picks on CNBC Richard Rossow, Senior Adviser and Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that a deal between the U.S. and India is ""still very much possible"" as the South Asian country puts forth substantial sweeteners.

GS," Harriet AgnewandJosh Speroin London, andOrtenca AliajandSilvia Sciorilli Borrelliin Milan PublishedAugust 29 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Walking down the cobbled streets of Milan’s trendy Brera district on the last day of March, one senior banking executive spotted three international removal trucks. “It was incredible,” he said of an influx of new residents in the city ahead of the end of the UK tax year on April 5. “There was an explosion of arrivals.” Italy’s welcoming tax regime has drawn throngs of wealthy newcomers to the country’s financial centre, bringing new strains to the city, particularly in a real estate market where demand far outstrips supply and that is now the focus of asprawling corruption investigation. But it has also given Milan a buzz some liken to London in the 1990s — with adolce vitatwist. Milan’s transformation has its roots in a series of 2016 tax breaks under Italy’s then prime minister Matteo Renzi, whose centre-left administration set out to reverse the country’s brain drain and lure wealthy foreigners. But the shift has gained momentum, particularly in the past 12 months after the UK’s decision to abolish its 226-year-old rules for non-domiciled residents, exposing their overseas assets to a 40 per cent inheritance tax, and their foreign income and gains to the wider British fiscal regime. At the same time, Italy has been rolling out the red carpet to the world’s wealthy. A new foreign resident — or a returning Italian who has lived abroad for at least nine years — can pay a flat tax of €200,000 a year on any foreign income and assets for up to 15 years, and be fully exempt from inheritance tax on foreign assets during that period. “A few years ago the only people that lived in Milan had known each other since they were children, it was very local,” said Lydia Forte, group director of food and beverage at Rocco Forte Hotels. “Now, there are a lot of people moving there who have no connections to Italy.” Those who have left London for Milan include Nassef Sawiris, Egypt’s richest man and co-owner of English football club Aston Villa; Richard Gnodde, vice-chair of Goldman Sachs; and Yoël Zaoui, co-founder of advisory boutique Zaoui & Co. Rolly van Rappard, co-founder of private equity group CVC Capital Partners, is weighing a move, while Bernard Arnault’s son Frédéric is moving between Paris and Milan having taken the top job at LVMH-owned Loro Piana. They are just the tip of the iceberg. The flat tax scheme has attracted several thousand people, while more than 100,000 individuals, mainly Italians, have benefited from a scheme for those arriving from overseas that gives a 50 per cent reduction on taxable Italian income, with most moving to Milan. “The big market is people who are 45-70 years old,” said Gary Landesberg, co-founder of The Wilde, one of a new crop of London-style members’ clubs that have opened in the city in recent years, adding that “you’re not just talking about billionaires”. Nadim Nsouli, founder and chief executive of Inspired Education Group, said Dubai and Milan were the top destinations for the roughly 200 pupils out of a total of 4,500 at its UK private schools who have relocated overseas in the past few years. Of new joiners at its 10 schools in Italy, four of which are in Milan, 45 per cent are typically foreign nationals, with the largest cohorts coming from the UK, the US and France. While those who have quit London for Milan give various reasons for their moves, many speak of a combination of the “push” factor from the UK and the “pull” factors of Italy, with fiscal sweeteners only part of the equation. Citing the quality of life in the Italian city as a draw, one private equity executive who has made the switch said he “wouldn’t do this to move to Dubai”, where there is no personal income tax, and that “if Frankfurt had offered the same deal I would not have gone to Frankfurt”. With the UK recently raising the tax on carried interest — private equity managers’ profits on successful deals — from 28 per cent to an effective 34 per cent by treating it as trading income, Italy’s flat rate of 26 per cent has made it an attractive destination for PE professionals and venture capitalists who are not on the flat tax regime. As part of a wider European expansion, alternatives firms including CVC, Preservation Capital and Ares have been opening and expanding offices in Milan in recent years, joined by hedge funds, including Capstone Investment Advisors and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management. Private capital executives said they saw opportunities to invest in and lend to Italy’s abundance of family-owned mid-market businesses. This trend has given bulge-bracket banks such as Goldman Sachs added incentive to widen their own footprints in the city to service rich clients. Such moves come as international lenders have been shifting activity from London to Paris, Milan and Frankfurt to continue serving EU clients post-Brexit, after the UK lost so-called passporting rights. Some of those who have moved to Milan are part of the peripatetic super-rich for whom the Italian city is one of several places they might spend a few months a year. Others form part of a younger generation who are putting down roots. “Milan is a great city to live in and has amazing connectivity,” said John Nery, the 41-year-old managing partner at private equity firm Squircle Capital, who moved to Milan five years ago from Qatar. “Portofino is a two-hour drive; you can be having lunch on the terrace of Villa d’Este on Lake Como in 45 minutes; and in three hours you can be in St Moritz, Megève or Verbier.” The international newcomers have added depth and variety to Milan’s social scene, reflected in a clutch of new venues that cater to them. Before The Wilde opened its doors last year, international members club Casa Cipriani launched in Milan in 2022, while Soho House is developing an outpost in the city. Contemporary art gallery Thaddaeus Ropac is opening a space in the Palazzo Belgioioso this autumn, and Rocco Forte Hotels’ Carlton Milan is due to open in November. Some Milanese complain that the influx has made their city “less authentic” and “a little bit over the top”. One banker said tensions had arisen at his company because new arrivals from the UK were on London salaries, far higher than their local counterparts, and criticised the new members’ clubs as “not really the Italian way of doing business”. A second local dismissed the clubs as being full of bankers and private equity executives, and only existing for those who could not get into old-school Milanese gentlemen’s clubs such as the Clubino and the Circolo dell’Unione. Even those who are enamoured with Milan complain of poor air quality and few parks, and note that the city empties out at weekends and in August. And while Milan is having a moment, Italy is not the most thriving of global economies and cannot offer the same opportunities for ambitious young people as there are in places such as the US or the UAE. “It’s still very bureaucratic,” said Nsouli of Inspired Education Group, notably around hiring and labour laws. “The bureaucracy is one thing they need to address if they really want to become a global city.” Nowhere is the flow of newcomers more keenly felt than in the real estate market, where prices have been pushed up by people accustomed to Kensington, Notting Hill and Mayfair prices. Several suites at the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental hotels in Milan’s historic centre have been occupied by financiers who relocated from London. Milan’s property scene has been struggling to satisfy demand for “trophy assets”, said Danilo Orlando, head of residential at estate agency Savills Italy. Purchase prices for 600 square metre plus penthouses in central locations with pool, gym and concierge start at $8mn-$10mn, according to Savills, while rents in Milan’s prime residential sector have risen more than 14 per cent over five years, against a 7 per cent increase in Rome. However, Milan remains far behind London, with an average price per square foot of €1,520 against €1,920 in the UK capital. The news is not all positive. Manfredi Catella, who as chief executive of developer Coima helped redevelop the former industrial Porta Nuova district into Milan’s most exclusive neighbourhood, was among six people placed under house arrest in July as part of a sprawling probe into Milan’s rapid real estate expansion. Although all six were released this month following an appeal, they and another 20 people, including mayor Giuseppe Sala, remain under investigation. Coima is redeveloping historical buildings in the city centre, including turning a block between the Mandarin Oriental and Bvlgari hotels into luxury residences and offices. Catella said internal checks had been carried out to confirm “the regularity” of the company’s actions and these could be “clearly represented in court”. Sala said in July he was “shocked” and that he “disavowed” the prosecutors’ interpretation of events. The legal developments are unlikely to stop the influx of newcomers and their need for housing. Marco Cerrato, a partner at law firm Maisto e Associati, said one client had difficulty finding a large house in the city “because Milan is made up of apartments”, so instead bought one an hour’s drive away in Lugano, Switzerland. But when it comes to the hotels, restaurants and other luxury services that the new arrivals desire, Cerrato believes the city is “fully equipped” because of the fashion and design contingents. Milan, he says, “was already ready”.",0.624300003051757,744.73,744.73,0.0,BUY,,
GS," Harriet AgnewandJosh Speroin London, andOrtenca AliajandSilvia Sciorilli Borrelliin Milan PublishedAugust 29 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Walking down the cobbled streets of Milan’s trendy Brera district on the last day of March, one senior banking executive spotted three international removal trucks. “It was incredible,” he said of an influx of new residents in the city ahead of the end of the UK tax year on April 5. “There was an explosion of arrivals.” Italy’s welcoming tax regime has drawn throngs of wealthy newcomers to the country’s financial centre, bringing new strains to the city, particularly in a real estate market where demand far outstrips supply and that is now the focus of asprawling corruption investigation. But it has also given Milan a buzz some liken to London in the 1990s — with adolce vitatwist. Milan’s transformation has its roots in a series of 2016 tax breaks under Italy’s then prime minister Matteo Renzi, whose centre-left administration set out to reverse the country’s brain drain and lure wealthy foreigners. But the shift has gained momentum, particularly in the past 12 months after the UK’s decision to abolish its 226-year-old rules for non-domiciled residents, exposing their overseas assets to a 40 per cent inheritance tax, and their foreign income and gains to the wider British fiscal regime.

NDAQ,"XRP’s slow push into institutional finance just picked up another backer.  Data-focused blockchain firm Flare announced on Friday that Everything Blockchain Inc.(OTC: EBZT), a U.S.-listed company, has signed a memorandum of understanding to adopt its XRP finance(XRPFi)framework for corporate treasury yield.  The move comes months after Nasdaq-listed VivoPower International PLC(NASDAQ: VVPR)committed $100 million in XRP to Flare’s ecosystem, making EBZT only the second public company to do so.  The agreements mark early steps in Flare’s effort to turn XRP — historically a non-yielding asset — into a productive instrument for institutions.  At the center of the framework is Flare’s “FAssets” system, a trustless bridge that gives smart contract functionality to tokens like XRP and bitcoin. Combined with Firelight, Flare’s restaking layer, the setup lets companies convert XRP into FXRP and allocate it across decentralized lending, staking and liquidity protocols.  “XRP, now a roughly $150 billion asset, has been a cornerstone of digital finance for more than a decade, yet institutions have had few ways to make it productive,” said Hugo Philion, Flare’s co-founder and CEO.  “Flare changes that by enabling a compliant, on-chain, non-custodial yield framework designed for corporate treasuries. With VivoPower and now Everything Blockchain, public companies are validating that XRPFi is not just a concept but an emerging institutional standard,” he added.  EBZT framed its decision as part of a broader shift in how public companies treat blockchain assets.  “This is about unlocking the true financial utility of digital assets like XRP, not just as speculative holdings, but as yield-bearing instruments that can compound over time,” said Arthur Rozenberg, the company’s CEO. “Flare gives us the rails to do this in a way that meets the governance, security, and auditability standards required of public companies.”  For now, the XRPFi push remains small in dollar terms relative to bitcoin or ether-based treasury pilots.  But two listed companies publicly adopting the model in under a year gives XRP a new narrative: less about speculation, more about yield, and potentially a step toward more mainstream corporate balance sheets.

Shares in the biggest UK banks tumbled on Friday on mounting fears that the government will target the sector at the Budget to help shore up the UK’s public finances. A surcharge on profits or even a new bank levy are seen as possible ways to help fill a fiscal hole estimated by economists to be at least £20bn. NatWest fell 5.3 per cent by early afternoon trading in London, with Lloyds Banking Group down 5.2 per cent and Barclays 3.8 per cent. The threebankswere the worst performers on the FTSE 100. The sell-off followed the publication of an earlier version of this article and areport by think-tank IPPRwhich proposed a new levy on profits. Some content could not load.

Benjamin Toms, analyst at RBC, said: “The chancellor has historically suggested that she understands that banks are conduits for growth in UK plc, but there is more pressure on her with this Budget to fill a funding shortfall, and banks are an easy target.” Executives are warning a tax raid would damage the government’s growth agenda but are bracing for it to happen. “Politically it is an easy target,” said one senior banker. “No one likes banks, they are seen as a whipping boy for the government.” Another City figure said: “We aren’t stupid. There’s a bunch of Labour MPs, including Angela Rayner, who are looking for ways to get more money. Financial services are an obvious target.” Rayner, the deputy prime minister,proposed raising the higher corporation tax ratefor banks from 28 per cent to 30 per cent in a memo to chancellor Rachel Reeves in May. Some Labour officials close to the Treasury agree that a move to raise bank taxes in the autumn Budget would help reassure the party that the government was sharing around the fiscal pain. One said: “They won’t do a wealth tax but they could do something on the edge of a wealth tax, like raising taxes for banks.” Another agreed that an increase in the bank corporation tax surcharge on profits was likely, perhaps raising up to £3bn. The sector is also subject to a separate balance sheet levy. The IPPR argued that the Treasury should impose a new levy to recoup “windfalls” made by lenders as a legacy of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme, undertaken following the financial crisis. The scheme entailed the BoE purchasing hundreds of billions of pounds of government bonds, buoying commercial bank reserves at the central bank. These are now being remunerated at the BoE’s official rate, which stands at 4 per cent. Reeves and the BoE have previously warned of the dangers of tinkering with the mechanism. Bank executives went public with pre-emptive warnings against fresh taxes on the sector during bumper results in the past few weeks. As Lloyds reported a surge in pre-tax profits to £2bn in the second quarter, Charlie Nunn, the lender’s chief executive, said increased taxes “wouldn’t be consistent” with the government’s growth agenda. NatWest chief Paul Thwaite insisted “strong economies need strong banks” as the lender also reported better than expected profits. Barclays chief CS Venkatakrishnan highlighted that financial institutions were already “among the biggest taxpayers in the country” while Georges Elhedery, HSBC chief executive, said higher taxes risked “eroding our continued investment capacity”. Another senior banker noted that the UK sector’s earnings and returns may have risen but valuations were still below US rivals and in line with historical averages. “These are not super profits,” they added. Any tax decisions taken by Reeves will be determined by the size of the fiscal hole exposed by Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, which have yet to be prepared for the autumn Budget. Estimates vary wildly about the state of the public finances. Higher debt interest and a possible OBR downgrade of productivity forecasts could worsen the situation, although some in the Treasury still hope that the hole could ultimately be less than £20bn. Reeves has said that securing growth is her priority and that she is acutely conscious of the risks of overtaxing the wealthy and productive parts of the economy. Speaking to the House of Commons Treasury select committee last November after her first Budget, Reeves said she had now set the envelope for spending for the parliament and that “we are not going to be coming back with more tax increases or, indeed, with more borrowing”. A Treasury spokesperson said on Thursday: “The best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy, which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms.” Industry lobby group UK Finance said: “Adding another tax would make the UK less internationally competitive and run counter to the government’s aim of supporting the financial services sector to help drive growth and investment in the wider economy.”",-0.961300015449523,95.98,95.98,0.0,SELL,,

WFC,"The de minimis exemption, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free, came to an end globally on Friday.The provision had been slated to end in July of 2027 but an executive order from President Trump eliminated it much sooner, giving businesses, customs officials and postal services less time to prepare.Companies big and small have used the exemption to save money on digital fulfillment, and the change could lead to higher prices.Small business owners on Etsy, eBay and Shopify, for example, relied on the provision to support their marketplace businesses. The de minimis exemption, an obscure trade law provision that has simultaneously fueled and eroded businesses across the globe, officially came to an end on Friday following an executive order by PresidentDonald Trump.For nearly a decade, shipments valued under $800 were allowed to enter the country virtually duty-free and with less oversight. Now, those shipments from the likes ofTapestry,Lululemonand just about any other retailer with an online presencewill be tariffed and processedin the same way that larger packages are handled.In May, Trump ended the exemption forgoods coming from Chinaand Hong Kong, and on July 30 he expanded the rollback to all countries, calling it a ""catastrophic loophole"" that's been used to evade tariffs and get ""unsafe or below-market"" products into the U.S.The de minimis exemption had previously been slated to end in July 2027 as part of sweeping legislation passed by Congress, but Trump's executive order eliminated the provisionmuch sooner, giving businesses, customs officials and postal services less time to prepare.""The ending of that under-$800-per-person-per-day rule, from a global perspective, is about to probably cause a bit of pandemonium,"" said Lynlee Brown, a partner in the global trade division at accounting firm EY. ""There's a financial implication, there's an operational implication, and then there's pure compliance, right? Like, these have all been informal entries. No one's really looked at them.""Already, the sudden change has snarled supply chains from France to Singapore and led post offices across the world totemporarily suspend shipmentsto the U.S. so they can ensure their systems are updated and able to comply with the new regulations.It's forced businesses both large and small to rethink not just their supply chains, but their overall business models, because of the impact the change could have on their bottom lines – setting off a panic in boardrooms across the country, logistics experts said.""Obviously it's a big change for operating models for companies, not just the Sheins and the Temus, but for companies that have historically had e-com and brick-and-mortar stores,"" Brown said.The change also means consumers, already are under pressure from persistent inflation and high interest rates, could now seeeven higher priceson a wide range of goods, from Colombian bathing suits to specialty ramen subscription boxes shipped straight from Japan.The end of de minimiscould cost U.S. consumersat least $10.9 billion, or $136 per family,according to a 2025 paperby Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The research found low-income and minority consumers would feel the biggest impact as they rely more on the cheaper, imported purchases. Popularized by Chinese e-tailers Shein and Temu, use of the de minimis exemption has exploded in the last decade, ballooning from 134 million shipments in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024. Before the recent change to limit its use, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments into the country each day.A2023 House reportfound more than 60% of de minimis shipments in 2021 came from China, but because the packages require less information than larger containers, very little information is known about their origins and the types of goods they contain. That opacity is one of the key reasons why both former President Joe Biden and Trump sought to curtail or end the exemption.Both administrations have said that the exemption wasoverused and abusedand that it's made it difficult for CBP officials to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S. because the packages aren't subject to the same level of scrutiny as larger containers.""We didn't have any compliance information … on those shipments, and then that is where the danger of drugs and whatnot being in those shipments"" comes in, said Irina Vaysfeld, a principal in KPMG's trade and customs practice.The Biden administration particularly focused on how the exemption allowed goodsmade with forced laborto make it into the country in violation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Meanwhile, Trump has said the exemption has been used to ship fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the U.S. In afact sheetpublished on July 30, the White House said 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal 2024, including 98% of narcotics seizures and 97% of intellectual property rights seizures, originated as de minimis shipments.Across the globe, it's common for countries to allow low-value shipments to be imported duty-free as a means to streamline and facilitate global trade, but typically, it's for packages valued around $200, not $800, said EY's Brown.Until 2016, the U.S. threshold for low-value shipments was also $200, but it was changed to $800 when Congress passed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which sought to benefit businesses, U.S. consumers and the overall U.S. economy, according to the Congressional Research Service. It said higher thresholds provide a ""significant economic benefit"" to both business and shoppers and thus, the overall economy.While well intentioned, the law came with unintended consequences, said Brown.The ""rise in value, from $200 to $800, just made it kind of like a free for all to say, 'OK, everything come in,'"" she said.Eventually companies designed supply chains around the exemption: They set up bonded warehouses, where duties can be deferred prior to export, in places like Canada and Mexico and then imported goods in bulk to those regions before sending them across the border one by one, duty-free, as customer orders rolled in, said Brown.""Companies have really laid out their supply chain in a very specific way [around de minimis] and that's really the crux of the issue,"" said KPMG's Vaysfeld. ""The way that the supply chain has been laid out now may need to change."" Until the rise of Shein and Temu, the de minimis exemption was rarely discussed in retail circles. Soon, the e-commerce behemoths began facing widespread criticism for their use of what many called a loophole.In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Partyreleased a reporton Shein and Temu and said the two companies were ""likely responsible for more than 30 percent of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China.""The revelation sparked widespread consternation among retail executives, lobbyists and government officials who said the companies' use of the exemption was unfair competition.However, behind closed doors, companies large and small began mimicking the same model after realizing how it could reduce the steep costs that come along with selling goods online.Direct-to-consumer companies that only have online presences have relied on it more heavily, so much so that their businesses may not work without it, said Vaysfeld.""Some of the companies we've spoken to, they've modeled out, if the tariffs continue for one year, for two years, how does that impact their profitability, and they know how long they can last,"" said Vaysfeld. ""These aren't the huge companies, right? These are the smaller companies. … Depending on what country they're sourcing from or where they're manufacturing, it could really impact their profitability that they can't stay in business for the long term.""While smaller, digital companies are more exposed, ""pretty much most companies that you can think of"" had been using the exemption in some form before it ended, said Vaysfeld.Take Coach and Kate Spade's parent company Tapestry: About 13% to 14% of the company's sales were previously covered under de minimis and will now be subject to a 30% tariff, according to an estimate by equity research firm Barclays.On the company's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said tariffs will hit its profits by a total of $160 million this year, including the impact of the end of de minimis. That amounts to about 2.3% of margin headwind, he said.Shares of the company fell nearly 16% the day that Tapestryreported the profit hit.In a statement, Roe said Tapestry used de minimis to help support its strong online business, adding it is a practice that ""many companies with sophisticated supply chains have been doing for years.""To help offset its termination, he said Tapestry is looking for ways to reduce costs and is leaning on its manufacturing footprint across many different countries.Canadian retailer Lululemon is another company that uses de minimis, according to Wells Fargo. Last week, the bank cut its price target on the company's stock from $225 to $205, citing the end of de minimis. In the note, Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said the equity research firm sees a potential 90 cent to $1.10 headwind to Lululemon's earnings per share from the de minimis elimination.Lululemon declined to comment, citing the company's quiet period ahead of its reporting earnings.The National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade organization, has not taken a position in favor of or against the exemption. It has members who both supported and opposed the policy, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at NRF.Retailers of all sizes, including independent sellers with digital storefronts, have used the approach as ""a convenient way to get products to the consumer"" for less, Gold said.""Their costs are going to go up and those costs could be passed on to the consumer at the end of the day,"" Gold said. The most acute impact of the end of de minimis is expected to be felt on online marketplaces where millions of small businesses sell goods likeEtsy,eBayandShopifyand used de minimis to defray costs when sending online orders from other parts of the globe to the U.S.American shoppers have gotten used to buying artwork, coffee mugs, T-shirts and other items from merchants outside the country without paying duties. With that tariff exemption gone, consumers could face higher costs and a more limited selection of items to choose from.Etsy, eBay and some other retailers sought to defend the loophole prior to its removal, submitting public comments on proposed de minimis regulation by the CBP. An eBay public policy executive said the company was concerned that restrictions to de minimis ""would impose significant burdens on American consumers and importers.""Etsy's head of public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said the artisan marketplace supports ""smart U.S. de minimis reform,"" but that it was wary of changes that could ""disproportionately affect small American sellers.""""These exemptions are a powerful tool that help small creators, artisans and makers participate in and navigate cross-border trade,"" Zubricki wrote in a March letter to CBP.An Etsy spokesperson declined to comment on the policy change. Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said at a Bernstein conference in May that transactions between U.S. buyers and European sellers make up about 25% of the company's gross merchandise sales.EBay didn't immediately provide a comment in response to a request from CNBC. The companywarnedin its latest earnings report that the end of de minimis outside of China could impact its guidance, though CEO Jamie Iannone told CNBCin Julythat he believes eBay is generally ""well suited"" to navigate the shifting trade environment.Some eBay and Etsy sellers based in the U.K., Canada and other countries are temporarily closing off their businesses to the U.S. as they work out a plan to navigate the higher tariffs. Blair Nadeau, who owns a Canadian bridal accessories company, was forced to take that step this week.""This is devastating on so many levels and millions of small businesses worldwide are now having their careers, passions and livelihoods threatened,"" Nadeau wrote in anInstagram poston Tuesday. ""Just this past hour I have had to turn away two U.S. customers and it broke my heart.""Nadeau sells her bespoke wedding veils, jewelry and hair adornments through her own website and on Etsy, where 70% of her customer base is in the U.S. The de minimis provision had been a ""lifeline"" for many Canadian businesses to get their products in the hands of American consumers, Nadeau said in an interview.""This is really hitting me,"" Nadeau said. ""It's like all of a sudden 70% of your salary has been removed overnight.""In the absence of de minimis, online merchants are faced with either paying import charges upfront and potentially passing those costs on to shoppers through price hikes, or shipping products ""delivery duty unpaid,"" in which case it's the customer's responsibility to pay any duties upon arrival.Alexandra Birchmore, an artist based in the Cotswolds region of England, said she expects to raise the price of her oil paintings on Etsy by 10% as a result of paying the duties upfront.""At the moment every small business forum I am on is in chaos about this,"" Birchmore said. ""It looks to me to be a disaster where no one benefits."" The disruption could end up being a boon for the likes ofAmazonandWalmart. U.S. consumers may turn to major retailers if they face steeper prices elsewhere, as well as potential shipping delays due to backlogs or other issues at the border.Amazon, in particular, has already proven resilient after the U.S. axed the de minimis provision for shipments from China and Hong Kong in May. The company's sales increased 13% in the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with 10% growth in the prior quarter. Amazon's unit sales grew 12%, an acceleration from the first quarter.Both Amazon and Walmart have fulfillment operations in the U.S. that allow overseas businesses to ship items in bulk and store them in the companies' warehouses before they're dispatched to shoppers. Shein and Temu largely eschewed the model in the past in favor of the de minimis exception, but they've since moved to open more warehouses in the U.S. in the wake of rising tariffs.Since the exemption ended on Chinese imports in May, the impact on Shein and Temu has been swift. Temu was forced to change its business model in the U.S. and stop shipping products to American consumers from Chinese factories.The end of de minimis, as well as Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports, also forced Temu to raise prices, rein in its aggressive onlineadvertising pushand adjust which goods were available to American shoppers.The Financial Timesreportedon Tuesday that Temu has resumed shipping goods to the U.S. from Chinese factories and will also increase its advertising spend following what it called a ""truce"" between Washington and Beijing.Temu didn't return a request for comment.Meanwhile, Shein has been forced to raise prices and daily active users on both platforms in the U.S. have fallen since the de minimis loophole was closed,CNBC previously reported. Temu's U.S. daily active users plunged 52% in May versus March, while Shein's were down 25%, according to data shared with CNBC by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.Correction: This article has been updated to correct the name of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

WELL," Henry Foyin Plovdiv PublishedAugust 31 2025 Simply sign up to theWar in UkrainemyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. European capitals are working on “pretty precise plans” for potential military deployments to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees that will have the full backing of US capabilities, Ursula von der Leyen has said. There was a “clear road map” for possible deployments, the European Commission president told the Financial Times in an interview. “Security guarantees are paramount and absolutely crucial,”von der Leyensaid. “We have a clear road map and we had an agreement in the White House . . . and this work is going forward very well.” Von der Leyen spoke while on a tour of eastern EU states close to Russia this weekend, during which she is focusing on efforts to increase national defence spending and bolster the continent’s military readiness. Her remarks came amid planning for a meeting of European leaders this week at which they are set to firm up national commitments to the western force. She said capitals were working on plans for “a multinational troop [deployment] and the backstop of the Americans”. “President Trump reassured us that there will be [an] American presence as part of the backstop,” she said. “That was very clear and repeatedly affirmed.” Ukraine has demanded concrete security guarantees from its western backers, including troops on the ground, as part of any peace deal to end Russian President Vladimir Putin’sthree-and-a-half-year war. The troops are set to include potentially tens of thousands of European-led personnel, backed by assistance from the US including command and control systems and intelligence and surveillance assets. That arrangement wasagreed at a meetingbetween President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and senior European leaders last month. Those who met Trump in Washington are expected to gather in Paris on Thursday at the invitation of France’s President Emmanuel Macron to continue the high-level discussions, three diplomats briefed on the plans told the FT. They include German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte and von der Leyen. The Elysée declined to comment. Last week, defence chiefs from the so-called coalition of the willing met and had “worked out pretty precise plans”, von der Leyen said, including discussions on “the necessary items for a functioning build-up of troops”. “Of course, it always needs the political decision of the respective country, because deploying troops is one of the most important sovereign decisions of a nation,” she added. “[But] the sense of urgency is very high . . . it’s moving forward. It’s really taking shape.” Von der Leyen praised Trump’s commitment toparticipating in the peace effort, after months of uncertainty in European capitals about the stance of the US president, who had in the past praised Putin and clashed with Zelenskyy. “Putin has not changed, he is a predator,” she said. “[Trump] wants peace and Putin is not coming to the negotiation table . . . He has a negative experience with Putin; more and more Putin does not do what he says. “[But] we have had in the last months several encounters where it was obvious that one can rely on the Europeans,” she added. “It is clear that when we say something, we do it.” Any western military deployment to post-conflict Ukraine would support a significantly strengthened Ukrainian army, which would form the core of the deterrence force. The commission would explore new funding streams to provide “sustainable financing of the Ukrainian armed forces as . . . a security guarantee”, von der Leyen said. After any peace deal, Kyiv would need “quite a sizeable number of soldiers and they need good salaries and of course, modern equipment . . . it’s for sure the EU that will have to chip in”. Recommended Brussels’ existing funding streams to Ukraine, including budgetary support, would need to remain during peacetime, von der Leyen said, meaning that “an extra payment . . . has to be provided for the Ukrainian armed forces”. The EU will also maintain funding for the training of Ukrainian soldiers after any peace deal. It is encouraging member states touse a €150bn loans-for-arms fundto either enter into joint production agreements with Ukrainian defence companies or to purchase weapons that can be given to Kyiv. “The role of the commission is paramount in enabling the member states to finance a surge in defence,” von der Leyen said. “The character of warfare has completely changed,” she added, citing the need for EU militaries to invest in drones, air and missile defence, space and cyber capabilities.

More than 3.26 trillion PEPE tokens changed hands during the session, with the strongest volumes recorded during the recovery phase, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. After dipping to the session’s low, PEPE rebounded sharply as buyers stepped in at support levels. That surge lifted the price close to an intraday peak. The market responded to the transfer with sustained buying interest, a sign of confidence or opportunistic accumulation. Still, bearish pressure hasn’t vanished. Resistance remains firm just below $0.00001, and price action continues to test support levels.

MKC," Olaf Storbeckin Frankfurt andClaire Jonesin Washington PublishedSeptember 1 2025 UpdatedSeptember 1 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world Financial markets have not fully priced in the risks posed by Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve, which include higher inflation and a loss of confidence in US government debt, economists warn in a survey by the Financial Times. The US president’s interventions against the world’s most powerful central bank have led to fears that the Fed’s powers to setinterest ratesto keep inflation in check will be compromised. In the poll of 94 economists based in the US and Europe, many feared that the assaults would lead to a permanent shift at theFedtowards prioritising jobs and lowering government borrowing costs once chair Jay Powell’s term as chair ends next year. “The Fed will become a puppet of the government,” said Christiane Baumeister, an economist at University of Notre Dame, who was among the respondents. Various other participants described the outlook for US monetary policy as “horrible”, “chaos”, and a “disaster”. Separately, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday that any loss of the Fed’s independence would pose a “serious danger” to the US and global economies, telling France’s Radio Classique that it would be “very worrying” if US monetary policy “were no longer independent and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person”. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the Fed since the start of his second term, labelling Powell a “numbskull” over his refusal to cut rates this year. The White House escalated its attacks in late August by announcing the sacking of Fed governorLisa Cookwith immediate effect. Cook has refused to leave and isfighting Trump through the courtsin what legal scholars say will be a test of how much power the White House can exert on the central bank. In the online poll of academic and private sector economists conducted between Wednesday and Friday last week, 89 of the 94 participants warned that the row had already damaged the Fed’s credibility. More than a quarter of the economists fear that by the end of Trump’s term in 2029, the Fed will be unable to fulfil its mandate to set US borrowing costs free from political influence, although 45 per cent think it is too early to tell in what shape the central bank will be by then. According to the survey, 28 per cent are cautiously optimistic, predicting that while the Fed’s independence will be reduced by 2029, it will still be able to do its job. Congress provides checks on the White House’s power, with a Senate majority needed to approve presidential nominations for senior officials and authorise changes to the governance of the central bank. A hearing for Trump’s latest pick for governor, Stephen Miran, is set for Thursday. A majority — 52 per cent — of poll respondents expect that the Fed’s focus will already change next year after Powell’s term as chair has expired, predicting that the central bank will then put more emphasis on lower government borrowing costs and jobs “at the expense of price stability”. There is consensus among the economists that Trump’s attacks would — if they lead to a weakening of the central bank’s independence — wreak damage on the world’s largest economy. “This is one area where most economists agree,” said Rüdiger Bachmann, professor of economics at University of Michigan, adding that the Fed’s independence “leads to lower and more stable inflation and financial stability”. Trump’s attacks risked unleashing strong inflationary forces, according to 42 per cent of the participants. Another 35 per cent said that a potential loss of investor confidence in US Treasuries was the biggest risk. Only one respondent said that Trump’s attacks on Fed independence did not constitute a “meaningful risk” to the economy. The Fed has had the right to set interest rates free of political pressure since 1951. While several US presidents have called for lower borrowing costs in the intervening decades, none have been as aggressive as Trump. The president wants borrowing costs at 1 per cent to goose the economy and cut the government’s refinancing costs by “hundreds of billions of dollars”. “In order to get a sense of the risks the White House is running by trying to subjugate the central bank, we need look no further than Turkey,” said Moritz Kraemer, chief economist at German lender LBBW, adding that the US dollar “has more credibility to lose” than the Turkish Lira. Karsten Junius, of private bank J Safra Sarasin, said the Fed would have to “fight for its survival or risk a US dollar crisis”. Earlier threats to fire Powell triggered a strong reaction from investors, but markets reacted with a whimper to news of Cook’s firing. Eighty-two per cent of the participants in the FT poll are convinced that financial markets have so far priced in the White House’s interventions on the Fed only partially or marginally, while another 12 per cent think the attacks are not priced in at all for now. “Financial markets might not push back enough to make a difference,” said Derek Tang of LH Meyer, adding that Trump’s success in threatening the Fed “might only embolden attacks on other central banks”.

Earlier threats to fire Powell triggered a strong reaction from investors, but markets reacted with a whimper to news of Cook’s firing. Eighty-two per cent of the participants in the FT poll are convinced that financial markets have so far priced in the White House’s interventions on the Fed only partially or marginally, while another 12 per cent think the attacks are not priced in at all for now. “Financial markets might not push back enough to make a difference,” said Derek Tang of LH Meyer, adding that Trump’s success in threatening the Fed “might only embolden attacks on other central banks”.

ORCL,"Solv Protocol, a financial services provider for bitcoinBTC$108,660.04holders, has partnered with decentralized oracle network Chainlink to integrate real-time verification of Solv's actual BTC reserves backing its liquid token, SolvBTC, directly into its price feed. This integration enhances transparency and builds greater trust for users. Unlike traditional price feeds that rely solely on market data, the new SolvBTC-BTC Secure Exchange Rate feed combines exchange rate calculations with real-time proof of reserves, delivering an on-chain redemption rate firmly anchored in verifiable collateral. Additionally, the mechanism features built-in upper and lower bounds based on reserve data, making it resistant to manipulation and safer for use in decentralized lending markets such as Aave. “We’re excited to work with Chainlink to launch a Secure Exchange Rate feed. This marks a major evolution in DeFi security, allowing protocols to more accurately price wrapped assets by leveraging redemption rates rooted in verifiable collateral, powered by the Chainlink standard,” said Ryan Chow, Co-Founder and CEO of Solv, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. The SolvBTC-BTC Secure Exchange Rate feed is now live on the Ethereum mainnet, with plans to expand to other chains, including BOB. SolvBTC, launched in April 2024, is a bitcoin-backed liquid staking token that enables BTC holders to participate in decentralised finance(DeFi)ecosystems and earn yield while maintaining BTC exposure. Users can deposit BTC and mint SolvBTC, a liquid representation of staked BTC, usable across various DeFi protocols, including vaults, decentralized exchanges(DEXs), and lending platforms.

PGR," John Muellbauer PublishedAugust 31 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. The writer is professor of economics at Oxford university As the UK government faces fiscal challenges, it is considering options to raise tax revenue that were previously off the table. Proposals such as a 2 per cent tax on wealth over £10mn have made headlines. However, many expensive assets — such as paintings and yachts — are mobile, unlike fixed property and land. Instead, the government should replace the top two bands of council tax, covering around 1.1mn properties in England and Wales, with an annual wealth tax of 0.5 per cent as well as a 1 per cent tax on all agricultural and unoccupied land valued above £40,000 per hectare. For non-UK taxpayers and owners of second homes, the rate would be 1 per cent, lower than typical US property tax rates. Crucially, the great majority of homeowners and farmers would be untouched by these reforms. UK council tax is based on 1991 property valuations, grouped into eight price bands and paid by tenants. It is probably the world’s most unfair property tax: the poorest pay the highest tax as a percentage of property value and the richest the least. It is also unfair regionally. The tax revenue raised by a home in the top band is around £4,500 in Nottingham but just £1,060 in Westminster. Governments tend to balk at wholesale reforms, even when winners outnumber losers. This is why stamp duty land tax, at high and progressive rates, affecting only a small number of property owners in a given year, has endured, despite its consequences for social mobility and economic efficiency. Losers, especially the wealthy, shout louder than winners. The outdated nature of property valuations creates additional problems. But politicians are fearful of the upheaval created by revaluation. By confining revaluation and reform to the top two council tax bands, the costs and political pushback would be limited. To protect cash-poor pensioners, payment deferral should be permitted until the property was sold, with a 0.6 per cent tax rate instead of 0.5 per cent for cash payers. For every year deferred, the tax authority’s equity stake in the property would rise by 0.6 per cent. Estimates suggest such a tax could increase revenue from the two top council tax bands by as much as £9bn. Only revenue in excess of what council tax would have raised would accrue to the central government, ensuring that no local authority loses out. Tax collection, based on owners rather than occupiers, would be run by HMRC, not local authorities. A fall in top-end property prices in London and south-east England would be likely to follow as the holding cost of ownership rises. However, a reduction in the highest stamp duty rates for expensive property, to a top rate of 5 per cent, would stabilise the market. (Those who have recently paid high rates of stamp duty will need reductions in future property tax liabilities.) Several benefits would follow. Fewer luxury homes bought by foreign investors to park money will sit empty. With lower deposits needed to access a mortgage and lower stamp duty rates, housing affordability will improve for high earners — boosting future employment and income tax revenue. A shift in developer incentives away from luxury housing and lower local land prices in high-value areas should improve housing affordability more broadly. A tax on current market values of non-residential land in expensive locations would also have widespread benefits. It would lower farmland prices potentially relevant for development, especially for projected new towns. Introducing holding costs on undeveloped land would facilitateland value capture— a crucial tool in supporting the government’s affordable housing plans — so that surrounding communities and society more broadly benefit from gains rather than letting existing landowners reap so much of the profits. Many voters, as well as Labour backbenchers, feel that the new government has neglected issues of fairness. The proposed reform asserts fiscal probity while addressing this concern.",-0.00719999987632,247.06,247.06,0.0,HOLD,,

SOLV,"MicroStrategy, now doing business asStrategy(MSTR), has officially qualified for potential inclusion in the S&P 500 after posting one of the strongest quarters in its history. In thesecond quarterof 2025, the company reported $14 billion in operating income and $10 billion in net income, equal to $32.6 in diluted earnings per share. Quarterly revenue came in at $114.5 million, a modest 2.7% increase year-over-year, with subscription services rising nearly 70%. The results mark a dramatic turnaround from prior years, when impairment charges tied to bitcoinBTC$108,660.04depressed reported earnings. The adoption of new fair-value accounting standards in January 2025 allowed Strategy to recognize unrealized gains on its digital asset holdings, directly boosting profitability. With bitcoin trading above $100,000 during the period, the company booked massive paper gains that transformed its balance sheet. As of June 30, Strategy held 597,325 bitcoin. The firm highlighted a BTC Yield of 19.7% year-to-date, a key performance indicator measuring the percentage change in the ratio between its bitcoin count and assumed diluted shares outstanding. Management raised guidance for full-year 2025 to $34 billion in operating income, $24 billion in net income, and $80 in diluted EPS, assuming a year-end bitcoin price of $150,000. With consistent profitability now established,Strategy meets all S&P 500requirements: U.S. listing, market capitalization far above the $8.2 billion threshold, daily trading volumes exceeding 250,000 shares, more than 50% public float, and positive earnings both in the latest quarter and on a trailing twelve-month basis. The next potential window for inclusion is the September 2025 rebalance, with announcements expected Sept. 5 and changes taking effect Sept. 19. While the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee retains discretion, Strategy’s qualification underscores the growing role of bitcoin in mainstream financial markets. If admitted, it would be the first bitcoin-treasury company to enter the benchmark index, symbolizing a landmark moment for the integration of digital assets into U.S. equities.

XYZ,"U.S. President Donald Trump has held off from imposing further punitive sanctions on Russia.Meanwhile, Moscow has shown no signs of pursuing peace, and has increased its attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks.The reason for the standstill is strategic and goes beyond Russia, analysts told CNBC. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he will punish Russia and President Vladimir Putin if Moscow doesn't come to the table and agree to peace talks or a ceasefire with Ukraine.Russia has shown no signs of intending to do either, instead continuing and increasing its attacks on Ukraine as it looks to consolidate gains on the battlefield.And still, Trump is holding off on releasing a big bazooka of extra sanctions and economic punishment that could hurt an already weakened Russia.The reason for the standstill is strategic and goes beyond Russia, according to analysts, who warn the longer Trump holds off, the more he's undermining his and the U.S.' position.""The Russian budget is actually under a lot of pressure... so if there were to be any more significant sanctions targeting Russian oil trade from the U.S. — which they've talked about but not done — that would put the budget under greater pressure. It hasn't happened,"" Chris Weafer, the chief executive of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, told CNBC Monday.There were two significant factors behind Trump's reticence, Weafer said: the president's desire to be seen as a peace-broker, and concerns over pushing Russia deeper into China's orbit.""Trump still thinks he can bring both sides to the table, that he could broker a peace deal, and that he can take credit for moving the conflict towards peace. And bearing in mind that the announcement on the Nobel Peace Prize will come in early October, it's a factor, because we know the character of the of the individual,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""""The second reason ... is there is a sense that if Russia is defeated, if Russia is completely isolated by the West, and there's no way back in terms of engaging with the U.S. and Europe, then it has no choice but to go even further all-in with China, and that potentially then would strengthen China's position."" Bringing Russia and Beijing closer together would mean that the latter had ""almost unlimited"" access to energy resources, industrial materials and to the Arctic, the analyst said, noting that this could effectively block the U.S. from Russian-controlled parts of the Arctic.It would also allow China greater access to Russian military technology, such as stealth submarines, and further opportunities in space exploration.Officials in Washington were concerned about that, Weafer noted, adding, ""they don't want Russia to be essentially a more formal subsidiary of China. They want it to be more in the middle with engagement in the West. I think that's one reason why they're treading carefully for now.""CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment on its strategy toward Moscow and is awaiting a response.Ukraine, meanwhile, has watched as Trump has let self-imposed deadlines to act against Russia pass, with Kyiv left crestfallen at perceived missed opportunities to pressure Putin into a ceasefire.""Ukrainians had hoped that Trump's August 8 deadline for Putin to accept a cease-fire would provide more constant air defense,"" John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and the head of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said in analysis in August.Yet, they were disappointed when Trump let Putin cross his August 8 deadline to end the fighting without consequences. ""Instead, Trump focused on summitry with Putin, which has yet to yield Russian flexibility,"" Herbst wrote.""Now they are gritting their teeth and, with many of their European partners, waiting for White House officials to realize that Russia is playing them — and to take the strong measures that Trump promised if Russia continued its war on Ukraine,"" he added. Beijing and Moscow's leaders were seen to be putting on a display of bonhomie at the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit on Monday. The SCO is being attended by 20 foreign leaders, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Against a backdrop of war in Ukraine, Trump's tariffs and continuing oil trade, the major economies of China, Russia and India have deepened their economic and political ties while their respective relations with the West have frayed.Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingon Monday urged his fellow leaders attending the summit to strengthen their cooperation,and called on them to reject what he called a ""Cold War mentality.""Meanwhile, Putin told the SCO that his meeting with Trump in August had opened a path to finding a way to resolving the Ukrainian ""crisis,"" as he described the more than three-year war. Yet he thanked Russia's Asian allies for their support throughout the war. ""We value the efforts and propositions to solve the Ukrainian crisis of China, India and other strategic partners of ours. The mutual understanding that was reached at a recent Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska heads the same direction, I hope. It paves the way to peace in Ukraine, I hope.""Summits like the SCO were creating a new political and socio-economic ecosystem that could replace the ""outdated"" Euro-Atlantic-centered power model, Putin said.This new system ""would take into account the interests of a maximum number of countries and would be truly balanced,"" meaning ""a system in which one group of countries would not ensure its security at the expense of the others.""",-0.811800003051757,79.63,79.63,0.0,SELL,,

It hasn't happened,"" Chris Weafer, the chief executive of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, told CNBC Monday.There were two significant factors behind Trump's reticence, Weafer said: the president's desire to be seen as a peace-broker, and concerns over pushing Russia deeper into China's orbit.""Trump still thinks he can bring both sides to the table, that he could broker a peace deal, and that he can take credit for moving the conflict towards peace. And bearing in mind that the announcement on the Nobel Peace Prize will come in early October, it's a factor, because we know the character of the of the individual,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""""The second reason ... is there is a sense that if Russia is defeated, if Russia is completely isolated by the West, and there's no way back in terms of engaging with the U.S. and Europe, then it has no choice but to go even further all-in with China, and that potentially then would strengthen China's position."" Bringing Russia and Beijing closer together would mean that the latter had ""almost unlimited"" access to energy resources, industrial materials and to the Arctic, the analyst said, noting that this could effectively block the U.S. from Russian-controlled parts of the Arctic.It would also allow China greater access to Russian military technology, such as stealth submarines, and further opportunities in space exploration.Officials in Washington were concerned about that, Weafer noted, adding, ""they don't want Russia to be essentially a more formal subsidiary of China. They want it to be more in the middle with engagement in the West. I think that's one reason why they're treading carefully for now.""CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment on its strategy toward Moscow and is awaiting a response.Ukraine, meanwhile, has watched as Trump has let self-imposed deadlines to act against Russia pass, with Kyiv left crestfallen at perceived missed opportunities to pressure Putin into a ceasefire.""Ukrainians had hoped that Trump's August 8 deadline for Putin to accept a cease-fire would provide more constant air defense,"" John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and the head of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said in analysis in August.Yet, they were disappointed when Trump let Putin cross his August 8 deadline to end the fighting without consequences. ""Instead, Trump focused on summitry with Putin, which has yet to yield Russian flexibility,"" Herbst wrote.""Now they are gritting their teeth and, with many of their European partners, waiting for White House officials to realize that Russia is playing them — and to take the strong measures that Trump promised if Russia continued its war on Ukraine,"" he added. Beijing and Moscow's leaders were seen to be putting on a display of bonhomie at the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit on Monday. The SCO is being attended by 20 foreign leaders, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Against a backdrop of war in Ukraine, Trump's tariffs and continuing oil trade, the major economies of China, Russia and India have deepened their economic and political ties while their respective relations with the West have frayed.Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingon Monday urged his fellow leaders attending the summit to strengthen their cooperation,and called on them to reject what he called a ""Cold War mentality.""Meanwhile, Putin told the SCO that his meeting with Trump in August had opened a path to finding a way to resolving the Ukrainian ""crisis,"" as he described the more than three-year war. Yet he thanked Russia's Asian allies for their support throughout the war. ""We value the efforts and propositions to solve the Ukrainian crisis of China, India and other strategic partners of ours. The mutual understanding that was reached at a recent Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska heads the same direction, I hope. It paves the way to peace in Ukraine, I hope.""Summits like the SCO were creating a new political and socio-economic ecosystem that could replace the ""outdated"" Euro-Atlantic-centered power model, Putin said.This new system ""would take into account the interests of a maximum number of countries and would be truly balanced,"" meaning ""a system in which one group of countries would not ensure its security at the expense of the others.""",-0.811800003051757,79.63,79.63,0.0,SELL,,
BALL,"In 2024, employers with health insurance covered 75% to 85% of plan costs, and workers paid the rest via premiums, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.But health care prices are expected to rise in 2025, and employers could soon pass more expenses along to workers, a recent survey from Mercer found.Here's how I am planning for open enrollment amid uncertain costs. As a certified financial planner and personal finance reporter, I spend a lot of time thinking about saving money onrising medical expenses.Health insurance is akey employee benefit, and many workers don't spend much time picking the right plan, surveys show.Nearly one-third of health insurance enrolleesspent less than 30 minuteschoosing a plan in 2024, according to an Employee Benefit Research Institute survey of more than 2,000 participants in fall 2024.Some 48% of millennials, my generation, admitted to""blindly"" picking health plansbecause they didn't understand them, a separate Justworks survey of nearly 4,200 U.S. adults from late 2024 found.More from Personal Finance:Debt struggles hit consumers at all income levels — here's whyTrump accused Fed's Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. That can be hard to proveStudent loan repayment plans have shifted — and more changes are aheadPicking the wrong plan could be costly as health care prices rise.Companies expect health plan expenses toincrease by 9% in 2026, according to the nonprofit Business Group on Health, based on June survey responses from 121 large employers with plans covering 11.6 million workers.In 2024, employers offering health insurancecovered 75% to 85% of plan costs, and workers paid the rest via premiums and copays, according to a survey of 2,100 firms from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-care policy organization.But as plan costs rise, companies couldshift more expenses onto workersin 2025, financial consulting firm Mercer found, based on a survey of roughly 700 organizations.Amid uncertain costs, here's how I'm preparing for health care open enrollment choices this fall.Tracking health care spendingOne of the hardest parts of picking health insurance is knowing future needs. There is no crystal ball, but you can review past medical spending.Several years ago, I started tracking annual out-of-pocket health care costs, including co-payments, prescriptions, medical bills, over-the-counter expenses and more. It's tedious, but I use the number for two open enrollment tasks:Finding the right health insurance planDeciding how much to save in my flexible spending account (FSA)Total out-of-pocket expenses, along with detailed receipts, are also useful at tax time to see if I can claim themedical expense deduction, which isn't typical. (You must itemize tax breaks to qualify, and90% of filersuse the standard deduction, according to the latest IRS data. Even then, unreimbursed medical expenses have to exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.) Paying now vs. laterTypically, health plans offer two choices. You can pay more upfront via higher premiums from each paycheck. Or, you can pay more later with a bigger deductible, which is how much you owe before insurance kicks in.By tracking yearly medical expenses, I can see which option could be more affordable for the coming year.In some cases, the higher deductible is cheaper when you're healthy and rarely use services. Plus, many plans cover preventative care, such as yearly physicals, at no cost, before hitting the deductible.That strategy could change if I expect multiple treatments or a surgery. In that case, I would consider opting for the higher premium, lower deductible plan. Cover your health insurance deductibleRegardless of the health plan I choose, I always aim to cover my deductible plus other out-of-pocket expenses with my FSA, which is also funded via paycheck deductions.The money goes in before taxes, and I can spend those pretax funds on eligible healthcare expenses, co-payments and deductibles. I think of the tax savings like a discount.The downside of FSAs is I must spend the balance by the end of the calendar year — or forfeit the funds — with a small carryover allowed into the next year. I track that spending monthly to avoid a surprise balance in December.The average householdFSA contribution was $2,250in 2024, and 77% was expected to be spent by November, according to 2024 data from Numerator, a market research data provider. Leverage a health savings accountBefore joining CNBC, I was a full-time freelance writer for six years, with a high-deductible health insurance plan throughHealthcare.gov.Premiums were high, but I could contribute to ahealth savings account, which works like a long-term emergency fund for medical expenses. Unlike an FSA, the balance rolls over yearly.If you can afford to leave the money untouched, some HSAs let you invest the balance for long-term growth.HSAs offer three tax benefits. There's an upfront deduction for deposits, the funds grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free for eligible health care costs.In 2024, two-thirds of companiesoffered investment optionsfor HSA contributions, according to a survey from Plan Sponsor Council of America, which polled more than 500 employers in the summer of 2024.But only 18% of participants were investing their HSA balance, down slightly from the previous year, the survey found.",-0.228200003504753,52.65,52.65,0.0,SELL,,

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven bythree advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that producedmore power than the lasers had impartedto the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August,added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup hasbeen hard at workin Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound withhigh-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facilitywill be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buyhalf its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998,TAE Technologies(formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised$150 million in Junefrom existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups,Helionhas the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The companyraised $425 millionin January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusionburst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will usecoordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologiesis taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade,General Fusionhas raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, itlaid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat,injecting $22 millionin an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Tokamak Energytakes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised$125 million in November 2024to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energyisn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusionis bucking the trend, though, having attracted a€130 million Series Athat brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusionfollows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvelfires powerful lasersat a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Lightdropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple,Xcimertakes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, andredesign the technology that underpins itfrom the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple,Xcimertakes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, andredesign the technology that underpins itfrom the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven bythree advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that producedmore power than the lasers had impartedto the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August,added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup hasbeen hard at workin Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound withhigh-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facilitywill be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buyhalf its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998,TAE Technologies(formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised$150 million in Junefrom existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups,Helionhas the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The companyraised $425 millionin January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusionburst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will usecoordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologiesis taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade,General Fusionhas raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, itlaid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat,injecting $22 millionin an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Tokamak Energytakes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised$125 million in November 2024to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energyisn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusionis bucking the trend, though, having attracted a€130 million Series Athat brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusionfollows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvelfires powerful lasersat a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.

Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologiesis taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade,General Fusionhas raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, itlaid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat,injecting $22 millionin an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Tokamak Energytakes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised$125 million in November 2024to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energyisn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusionis bucking the trend, though, having attracted a€130 million Series Athat brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusionfollows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvelfires powerful lasersat a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Lightdropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple,Xcimertakes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, andredesign the technology that underpins itfrom the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

OMC," George Parkerin London PublishedSeptember 1 2025 UpdatedSeptember 1 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Sir Keir Starmer has announced a major shake-up of his Downing Street organisation as the UK prime minister attempts to get a grip on his government and arrest a slide in Labour’s poll ratings. Darren Jones, the Treasury chief secretary, will move to a new role in Number 10 in charge of “driving forward progress in key policy areas and reporting directly to the prime minister”, Downing Street said on Monday. Downing Street also confirmed that Starmer was beefing up Number 10’s economic heft with theappointment of Baroness Minouche Shafik, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, as his chief economic adviser. The Conservatives claimed the appointment of Jones and Shafik was a sign of Starmer creating a parallel economic power base in Number 10 and a loss of confidence in chancellor Rachel Reeves. “A stronger prime minister would have gone the whole hog and fired her, not just created his own shadow chancellor,” said Andrew Griffith, shadow business secretary. Reeves’ allies insisted the chancellor welcomed and had advocated the creation of a stronger economic team in Number 10, including the transfer of Jones. “It’s important that Number 10 has a strong economic voice just as it already does on foreign policy,” said one ally of Reeves. “This pushes the economic message across government and helps us do our job.” Meanwhile, Tim Allan, a former media adviser to Sir Tony Blair during his first term in office and founder of the Portland communications agency, has been hired to overhaul Starmer’s media operation. Starmer’s shake-up came as MPs returned to the House of Commons from their summer break, with the prime minister’s popularity languishing and Labour’s standing in the polls at just 20 per cent. Ministers are also preparing for a crucial Budget this autumn. The prime minister said the changes would “make Number 10 more powerful” and told the BBC that he shared voters’ frustration with the slow pace of change being implemented by his government. “I’m frustrated — I share the frustration and anger of voters,” he said. “They want change.” He said his government had spent the first year in office “fixing the foundations” and was now moving to “a delivery phase”. Starmer added that he would definitely lead Labour into the next general election, which must take place by 2029, talking of a “decade of renewal”. The appointment of Jones to the new role of “chief secretary to the prime minister” reflects Starmer’s acceptance that he needs to get a tighter grip on his government. Joneshad previously been charged at the Treasury with the politically sensitive task of negotiating a cross-Whitehall spending review, which was deemed by Starmer to have been well handled. “Keir thought about this over the summer,” said one ally of the prime minister. “He decided these were the right changes to bolster the operation and drive delivery across government from Number 10.” Jones, a former solicitor, will be seen as Starmer’s “enforcer”. Pat McFadden, Cabinet Office minister, who had previously performed some of that role, was said by his allies to be taking on “a greater role overseeing political strategy”. Recommended The appointment of Allan, who worked alongside Alastair Campbell in Blair’s media operation, is a sign that Starmer also wants to see a sharper communications effort in Number 10. Allan, who sold a majority stake in Portland to media marketing company Omnicom in 2012, represents a further move by Starmer to bring into his inner circle people associated with the last Labour government. Starmer has already brought back New Labour-era veterans Jonathan Powell as national security adviser and Lord Peter Mandelson as US ambassador. Allan will become Starmer’s executive director of communications based in Number 10 alongside Steph Driver, director of communications. James Lyons, current director of communications (strategy), is leaving Number 10 after less than a year in the post, as is Liz Lloyd, brought in by Starmer last year as his director of policy delivery last November. The departures of Lyons and Lloyd just months into their jobs will raise questions about Starmer’s judgment in making appointments — or perhaps whether the problem may actually lie with the prime minister himself. Starmer axed Sue Gray, his first Number 10 chief of staff, last year, while Matthew Doyle, the prime minister’s first communications director, also left his post within a year of Labour’s 2024 election win. At the Treasury, Jones will be replaced as Reeves’ deputy by James Murray, currently exchequer secretary. Murray will, in turn, be replaced by Dan Tomlinson, who was elected to parliament at the general election last year. Dan York-Smith, a respected Treasury official who has overseen tax and welfare policy at the finance ministry, will become Starmer’s principal private secretary.

ORCL,"Solv Protocol, a financial services provider for bitcoinBTC$111,846.73holders, has partnered with decentralized oracle network Chainlink to integrate real-time verification of Solv's actual BTC reserves backing its liquid token, SolvBTC, directly into its price feed. This integration enhances transparency and builds greater trust for users. Unlike traditional price feeds that rely solely on market data, the new SolvBTC-BTC Secure Exchange Rate feed combines exchange rate calculations with real-time proof of reserves, delivering an on-chain redemption rate firmly anchored in verifiable collateral. Additionally, the mechanism features built-in upper and lower bounds based on reserve data, making it resistant to manipulation and safer for use in decentralized lending markets such as Aave. “We’re excited to work with Chainlink to launch a Secure Exchange Rate feed. This marks a major evolution in DeFi security, allowing protocols to more accurately price wrapped assets by leveraging redemption rates rooted in verifiable collateral, powered by the Chainlink standard,” said Ryan Chow, Co-Founder and CEO of Solv, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. The SolvBTC-BTC Secure Exchange Rate feed is now live on the Ethereum mainnet, with plans to expand to other chains, including BOB. SolvBTC, launched in April 2024, is a bitcoin-backed liquid staking token that enables BTC holders to participate in decentralised finance(DeFi)ecosystems and earn yield while maintaining BTC exposure. Users can deposit BTC and mint SolvBTC, a liquid representation of staked BTC, usable across various DeFi protocols, including vaults, decentralized exchanges(DEXs), and lending platforms. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve(PoR)leverages its decentralized oracle network to verify that the on-chain supply of tokenized assets, like stablecoins or wrapped assets, is fully backed by actual reserves held off-chain or on other blockchains. With billions of dollars in wrapped assets circulating within DeFi, transparent, reliable pricing mechanisms are increasingly critical. By combining PoR with price feeds atop Chainlink's existing cross-chain interoperability via CCIP, Solv enables wrapped assets to function securely as collateral across multiple blockchains. Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, summarized it well: “By combining real-time collateral verification with exchange rate logic, this solution delivers a redemption rate rooted in cryptographic truth, raising the security standard for wrapped assets across DeFi.”  More For You PEPE Slips as Whale Offloads $4.8M Stake, Still Outperforms Memecoin Sector Despite the sell-off, PEPE rebounded sharply from it's session lows, with sustained buying interest and growing whale holdings.

TIANJIN, China — Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingon Monday urged members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to strengthen artificial intelligence cooperation, while rejecting what he called a ""Cold War mentality.""Xi was speaking at the largest-ever summit of the SCO to date, with more than 20 foreign leaders gathered in Tianjin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The meeting comes as China seeks to cast itself as a global peacemaker, against a backdrop of persistent trade tensions with the United States, Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict.Xi said China has invested $84 billion in other SCO countries and pledged support for 10,000 students to join Beijing's ""Luban"" vocational education program. He added that the SCO gathering presents an opportunity to chart a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation.Ahead of his remarks, Xi briefly gathered with Modi and Putin during a photo session with all SCO members. Xi is expected to meet with Putin this week, with the Russian leader scheduled to stay in China for a military parade in Beijing to commemorate 80 years since the end of World War II.Over the weekend, Xi met with at least 10 visiting leaders, including Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet.
