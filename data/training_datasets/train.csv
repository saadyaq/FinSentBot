APO," James Fontanella-Khanin New York PublishedAugust 18 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Soho House, the once-edgy London members’ club that turned exclusivity into a global business, is set to retreat from public markets in a deal led by one of the biggest US hotel owners. A group of investors headed by New York-based MCR Hotels — which owns 30,000 guest rooms across the US, including the1960s-themed TWA Hotel at JFK airport— is nearing an agreement to buy out Soho House’s remaining public shareholders at about $9 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. The take-private offer values the company at roughly $1.8bn, excluding debt, and hands investors a premium over Friday’s $7.60 close — though still well shy of the $14 price tag whenSoho House floated in 2021. A deal could be announced as early as this week. Ron Burkle, the club’s billionaire backer who has long controlled the group, will roll over his stake along with other existing investors, people briefed about the matter said. Apollo Global Management, the alternative asset manager, is expected to provide more than $800mn in debt and equity financing, the people added. The deal would draw a line under months of agitation by activist Dan Loeb. His Third Point hedge fund had pressed the board to seek outside suitors to secure a higher valuation. Recommended Soho House’s take-private move comes after the company has struggled as a public company. Last year, New York short sellerGlassHouse slammedwhat it called a “broken business model and terrible accounting”, claiming the group’s expansion into less affluent cities betrayed its brand and masked the fact it had never turned a profit in its 28-year history. Management hit back with an independent review that, it said, found “no material issues” in the company’s books. Over the past few quarters, the business has shown signs of turning a corner. Earlier this month, it reported its third straight quarterly profit. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the potential deal.",-0.12389999628067,139.39,139.39,0.0,SELL

JPM," Arash Massoudiin London andAkila Quinioin New York PublishedAugust 18 2025 Simply sign up to theUS banksmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Citigroup’s banking chief Vis Raghavan has accelerated a hiring spree of former JPMorgan Chase colleagues, with at least 10 senior investment bankers having now agreed to join the rival US bank. In the past month, Citi has named Amit Nayyar as co-head of European technology banking, Guillermo Baygual as co-head of global M&A, Pankaj Goel as co-head of technology investment banking, BJ Vargas as head of North American equity capital markets and Ashish Agarwal as a senior real estate banker. All five men held senior roles in JPMorgan’s investment bank. Raghavan worked at JPMorgan for more than 20 years, and was named global head of investment banking there before he quit to lead the turnaround of Citi’s corporate, commercial and investment banking business. The latest recruits joina cohort of fiveother ex-JPMorgan bankers who have already taken up senior roles in Citi’s investment bank. Chief among those was Achintya Mangla, widely seen as Raghavan’s trusted lieutenant at JPMorgan, who now heads financing for investment banking at Citi. Raghavan started at Citi in June last year, and the bank’s recruitment effort has gone into overdrive since his non-solicit agreement with JPMorgan expired. David Lomer, who worked with Raghavan until 2022 when he moved to private capital group ICG, is also expected to make the jump to Citi, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lomer, who served as head of ICG’s UK, Nordics and Benelux markets, has already resigned and is on gardening leave until later this year, some of the people said. ICG and Citi declined to comment. “What’s unusual here is the speed with which it is happening,” one veteran investment banker said about the recruitment drive. “The first thing you are trying to do is upgrade your talent. The second thing is political. You put your people in place so that your lieutenants can push your agenda forward in a large and complex organisation.” Citi has also recruited from outside Raghavan’s former colleagues at JPMorgan, with three senior hires from Goldman Sachs. Those include David Friedland, a partner who left the bank after 25 years to become co-head of North America investment banking coverage. The bank has also brought in Aashish Dhakad from Ares Management, as it seeks to grow its direct lending business through a $25bn private credit venture with Apollo. Citi’s investment bank has gained market share in the last year and ranks fifth globally in investment banking revenue with a 4.5 per cent market share according to Dealogic. Speaking at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley in June, Raghavan attributed the climb to the fact the bank was “hiring a lot of people” and said Citi was “just getting started in terms of talent investment”. Its investment banking fees rose 13 per cent in the second quarter as the bank advised on high-profile deals, including Nippon Steel’s $15bn acquisition of US Steel and Boeing’s sale of parts of its aviation software unit to Thoma Bravo. JPMorgan recently said it has hired more than 300 bankers since early 2024. A person close to the bank added that nearly a third of those roles were at managing director level.",0.161100000143051,290.49,290.49,0.0,BUY

Earlier this week, Variety and other Hollywood publications reported that Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers who created “Stranger Things” (and wrote and directed many episodes), werein talks to sign an exclusive deal with Paramount(nowunder the ownership of David Ellison’s Skydance). Then on Friday evening,Puck’s Matthew Belloni postedthat the Duffers had in fact “made their choice” and were going to Paramount. The Duffer Brothers’ ambition seems to have increased with each season of “Stranger Things,” as episodes have grown longer, set pieces have become more spectacular, and the budget has grown accordingly, witha reported Season 4 cost of $30 million per episode. So it’s not surprising that the Duffers are interested in making big-budget, tentpole movies next — an area where Netflix has struggled, in part due to its thorny relationship with the theatrical business, which co-CEOTed Sarandos recently describedas an “outdated concept.” While Netflix does release some movies in theaters, it has resisted giving those releases a significant exclusive window before launching on streaming, which means Netflix movies usually aren’t shown by the major chains. This was, apparently, a sticking point for “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig, so the first of her “Narnia” movies for Netflix willplay exclusively on Imax screensfor two weeks (or more) before going to streaming on Christmas Day 2026. And it seems this was also important to the Duffers, with Belloni reporting that the “theatrical component” turned out to be the “dealbreaker” in their negotiations. The brothers’ absence will not be immediately noticeable on Netflix, which will be releasing the final season of “Stranger Things” in three (!) parts later this year, and where the Duffers have two new shows scheduled to launch in 2026. Plus, the “Stranger Things” empire is growing, witha prequelplaying on Broadway,an animated seriescoming soon, and a live action spinoff reportedly in the works.

To be clear, the company isn’t claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains “highly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.” However, its announcement points toa recent program created to study what it calls “model welfare” and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, “working to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.” This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it’s only supposed to happen in “extreme edge cases,” such as “requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.” While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around howChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users’ delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a “strong preference against” responding to these requests and a “pattern of apparent distress” when it did so. As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, “In all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.” Anthropic also says Claude has been “directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.” When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. “We’re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,” the company says.

MSFT,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I’m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entrées on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman’s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: “No phone case is a bold choice.” Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone’s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one. “Listen, we’re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,” says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive’s forthcoming AI device. “If you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,” he jokes. Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers. For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI’s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it? Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT’s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5’s tone and its model router. But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI’s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI’s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software. OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts. Altman says OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications,Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT — ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of anAI-powered browserthat OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome. Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome — likely an offer that would be taken more seriously thanPerplexity’s bid— should it become available. “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,” he says before looking at all of us and asking: “Is it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn’t gonna happen.”Simo also might end up running an AI-poweredsocial media app— something the OpenAI CEO has said he’s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there’s “nothing” inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he’s interested in “whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.” While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup,Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. (“We have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.”) How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI’s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a “a company that we’d invest in.” For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5’s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place. Turley and Altman say they’ve learned a lot from the experience. “I legitimately just thought we screwed that up,” says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear “transition period” when deprecating AI models in the future. Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5’s responses “warmer,” but not sycophantic, such that it won’t reinforce negative behaviors in users. “GPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality — I’m German, you know, whatever,” says Turley. “But many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.” It’s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot — which could still be tens of millions of people. Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5’s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors. That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn’t hurt OpenAI’s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI’s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5’s launch, and the company is effectively “out of GPUs” thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models. In many ways, the night’s contradictions — disappointing launches, record-breaking usage — reflect OpenAI’s strange reality right now. Given OpenAI’s bets — and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy — Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google’s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader. As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren’t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that’s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product. It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it’s no longer defined by its best AI model.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage — that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home. “You’ve got to have a solar stalker” for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system. Showalter, the CEO ofEG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn’t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it’s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISApublished an advisorydetailing security vulnerabilities in EG4’s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system. For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4’s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they’re learning is that modern solar inverters aren’t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there’s excess power, feeding it back into the grid. Much of this has happened without people noticing. “Nobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,” observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. “Now we’re talking about it at the national and international level.” Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations — primarily residential — grewmore than fivefoldbetween 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change. Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent. When pressed about his company’s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. “This is not an EG4 problem,” he says. “This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a14-page reportcataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019. Not all of his customers — some of whomtook to Redditto complain — are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA’s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures. “These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. “Adding insult to injury,” continues this individual, “EG4 didn’t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.” Asked why EG4 didn’t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a “live and learn” moment. “Because we’re so close [to addressing CISA’s concerns] and it’s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the ‘done’ button, and then advise people, so we’re not in the middle of the cake being baked,” says Showalter. TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that “no known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.” While unrelated, the timing of EG4’s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment. Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries.According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers — components that hadn’t appeared on official hardware lists. This reported discovery carries particular weight given China’s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some200 GW of European solar power capacityis linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.The geopolitical implications haven’t escaped notice. Lithuania last yearpassed a lawblocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany. But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4’s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company’s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NISTwarnsthat “if you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.” The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations. Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, asevidenced by security researchers last year.) The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection standardscurrently applyonly to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms. Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements. But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum. On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes. “When you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,” he explains. “But when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.” Put another way, the real concern isn’t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity. Showalter has embraced CISA’s intervention as what he calls a “trust upgrade” — an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures. But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company’s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they’d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.

A block processed 43,016 successful transactions and 50 failed ones for a peak of 107,540 TPS, facilitated and processed by validator “Cavey Cool.”  Solana just did 107,540 TPS on mainnetyes, you read that correctlyover 100k TPS, on mainnetgood luck bearspic.twitter.com/nGF9Q1b86c  The spike was driven by no-operation, or “noop,” program calls, or lightweight instructions required in every transaction that don’t change state but can be used to stress-test network capacity.  Critics argue that such loads are artificial. But Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz said in an X post that the cost to the network wasn’t trivial: While execution compute units(CUs)are low, the “total cost” also accounts for signature verification, data loading and other non-execution overhead. That makes them comparable to a low-cost oracle update, rather than meaningless spam. there are also some technical details around thise.g one might point out the nature of the CUs for these calls, but it's more nuanced since there's also a ""total cost"" component to these (sig verify, data loading, etc) which also takes into account non-execution CUsand as…  As such, actual user-facing throughput is far lower as of Monday morning. On-chain trackerSolscan shows an average of 3,500 TPS, nearly two-thirds of which are validator vote transactions. Chainspect and Solscan peg effective throughput for payments and applications at roughly 1,000 TPS. Still, the data showed that Solana could theoretically sustain 80,000–100,000 TPS in real operations like transfers or oracle updates under peak conditions — improving the appeal of the network’s SOL(SOL)token.

TGT,"Crypto traders should remain vigilant for an ether(ETH)price drop below $4,200, which could trigger millions in long liquidations and increase market volatility. As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions – valued at $236 million – faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. ""[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,"" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations. This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

WELL,"LONDON — European stocks lost some ground on Monday as traders looked ahead to a meeting between regional leaders and U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss Ukraine.The pan-EuropeanStoxx 600index was 0.2% lower by 11:19 a.m. in London (6:19 a.m. ET), with most sectors and all major bourses in negative territory. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are traveling with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington to meet Trump at the White House to discuss a peace deal.Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the president could ""end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.""The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire. It's been widely reported since then that Putin told Trump that he would agree to one,if Russia was handed Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. On Sunday, U.S. special envoySteve Witkoffsuggested Ukrainecould be given some security guaranteesto bring an end to the war. Looking at individual stocks, shares of Danish wind turbine manufacturerVestas Windsurged 16.5% by 11:20 a.m. in London, taking the company to the top of the Stoxx 600.The gain came after the U.S. Internal Revenue Serviceissued new rulesaround tax credits for clean energy projects. Under the new system, developers will only be able to qualify once physical work on the project begins. Previously, they were able to claim tax relief by paying at least 5% of project costs and demonstrating that some form of work on the project was ongoing.Meanwhile, shares of Danish pharmaceutical giantNovo Nordiskwere up by 4% after the company's blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovywon regulatory approvalin the United States to treat a serious liver disease.At the other end of the Stoxx 600,Commerzbankwas 3.3% lower in late morning trade in London.The German lender was downgraded by strategists at Deutsche Bank on Monday, who lowered the stock from a ""buy"" rating to a ""hold.""""We continue to like the fundamental Commerzbank story, including rising profitability and capital return, as well as the upcoming benefits from the German fiscal stimulus,"" Deutsche Bank's Benjamin Goy said in a note. ""Nevertheless, after tripling over the last year, the shares now trade at a 20% to 42% P/E premium to the sector, even on our above-consensus forecasts.""Overnight,Asia-Pacific marketsmostly rose ahead of the talks, whileU.S. stock futurestraded slightly higher early Monday after hopes for lower interest rates fueled a winning week on Wall Street.There are no major earnings on Monday.

WELL,"Global markets were on tenterhooks Monday as momentum to end the war in Ukraine ramped up.Experts warn there is no ""quick fix,"" however, and talks could last years.European leaders and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy are heading to Washington for more discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. Global markets were on tenterhooks Monday as momentum to end the war in Ukraine appeared to be ramping up, with European leaders heading to Washington for more talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.European markets traded mixedahead of the summit later today at the White House, which followsTrump's high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putinin Alaska on Friday, whileU.S. stock futures had moved lower.Meanwhile,Asia-Pacific indicesovernight traded mostly higher in anticipation of the talks.Traders will be hoping that an end to the Russia-Ukraine war — a conflict which began in 2022 and which has shaken the global economy, disrupting trade and supply chains, and creating geopolitical chasms between major economies in the West and East — could be nearer now than at any other time.But those in the know say fledgling talks between stakeholders Russia, Ukraine, Europe and the U.S. are just the beginning of what could be a long and thorny path to a ceasefire — as Trump's inconclusive talks with Putin on Friday proved — let alone peace.That would be in stark contrast to Trump's well-documented love of a quick deal, and should be a wake-up call for global market optimism, experts say.""Peace agreements take a very, very long time to achieve,"" James Bindenagel, visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, told CNBC Monday. ""And what Putin has said is that he wants peace talks so he can continue the war, knowing that it won't come to a peace agreement for a very long time. That is simply not acceptable,"" he said.""You cannot negotiate on a peace agreement for five years, ten years, and let the Russians continue their war against the Ukrainians."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO chief Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are among the European leaders traveling to Washington for talks on Monday.They're accompanying Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine's future and possible conditions for a peace deal, including land swaps (reportedly proposed by Putin) and security guarantees — all seen as crucial by Europe, if there is to be a ceasefire and peace. Trump has ruled out the possibility of Ukraine regaining control of Crimea, which Russia invaded in 2014, and joining NATO. Zelenskyy is likely to come under pressure to enter a deal.In a post on Truth Social,Trump said the Ukrainian president could ""end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.""The meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, but the talks concluded without a ceasefire. It's been widely reported since then that Putin told Trump that he would agree to one,if Russia was handed Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.The view from Ukraine is not optimistic, considering that Putin had already rejected the offer of a ceasefire that could form the basis of peace negotiations. ""To achieve a big peace deal is much more difficult,"" Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, told CNBC on Monday. ""It's a difficult question with big details and it will take a lot of time,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition."" European defense stocks were in focus Monday, with traders betting on a positive outlook for the sector whatever the outcome of talks as European leaders have pledged to increase defense spending.On Monday, Germany'sRheinmetallwas up 2.8%, whileHensoldtandRenkwere also around 4% higher, respectively. Italian firm Leonardo was up 2.1% in early deals while London-listedBAE Systemsalso traded 2.3% higher andBabcock3.4% higher.""This is the beginning of a long negotiation,"" Olivia Allison, senior advisor at PRISM Strategic Intelligence, told CNBC Monday. ""Anyone looking for a quick fix will be disappointed,"" she noted. ""Regardless of the outcome ... there will be an emphasis on defense, on protecting critical national infrastructure, and I think the markets should also take that into account,"" she noted.""A peace deal, which I think will be a long process, is not an end to the relationship between Russia and Europe.""",-0.577899992465972,162.95,162.95,0.0,SELL
COIN,"Dogecoin retreated sharply on August 24–25 after spiking to $0.25, as heavy whale transfers to Binance coincided with distribution pressure and fading momentum at key resistance. Despite institutional accumulation earlier in the month, the token is now testing critical support levels. Market attention turned to DOGE after a 900 million token transfer(valued at over $200 million)was tracked moving to Binance wallets. The move raised concerns about short-term sell pressure just as the token’s rally toward $0.25 ran into resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain data showed whales accumulated over 680 million DOGE in August—suggesting deeper-pocketed investors remain positioned for long-term upside even as near-term technicals weaken.

Futures open interest in DOGE dipped 8%, reflecting lighter speculative positioning despite the month’s whale activity. • DOGE traded in a wide $0.02 range(8%)between $0.23 lows and $0.25 highs in the 24-hour period from August 24 at 06:00 to August 25 at 05:00.• The key breakout occurred at 19:00 UTC on August 24, when DOGE spiked to $0.25 on 2.29 billion volume—multiple times the daily average.• The move quickly reversed, with prices sliding to $0.23 and settling at $0.23 by session close, down 3% from the open.• In the final hour(04:44–05:43), DOGE fell another 0.4% as heavy volume broke through $0.229 intraday support, hitting lows near $0.228 before closing at $0.228. •Resistance: Heavy rejection at $0.25 confirmed strong overhead supply, with 2.29 billion tokens traded at the peak.•Support: Multiple retests anchored support near $0.23, though pressure persisted through late-session deterioration.•Pattern: Range-bound consolidation($0.228–$0.233)suggests buyers defending support but momentum favoring sellers.•Volume: Spikes of 10–12 million per minute during the 05:07–05:08 window signal institutional distribution.•Indicators: A golden cross remains intact on higher timeframes, but immediate momentum skews bearish without a reclaim of $0.24. • Whether $0.23 holds as durable support—loss of this level could open downside toward $0.21 psychological zone.• Follow-through on whale transfers: more Binance inflows could intensify sell pressure, while further accumulation would counterbalance.• Futures positioning: OI contraction suggests sidelined leverage, but a rebound could fuel the next move.• Macro backdrop: risk assets remain sensitive to central bank policy; dovish turns could provide relief rallies.• Broader meme coin flows: correlation with SHIB and PEPE rallies remains a secondary driver of speculative flows into DOGE.

COST," Martin Sandbu PublishedAugust 25 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world A “humiliation”, “economic surrender” and rhetoric that “appears to have been stolen fromthe adult entertainment industry”. These are just a small selection of Europeans’ reactions to how their leaders have kowtowed to Donald Trump — first for accepting the US president’s demand that Nato countries spend 5 per cent of national income on defence, then by endorsing a trade “deal” that leaves the EU much worse off than before. When Trump returned to the White House, European leaders seemed unconvinced as to how to handle him. By now, their strategic choice is evident. It is accommodation rather than confrontation, accompanied by flattering rhetoric noisily praising Trump’s peace- and dealmaking prowess. The question is whether the loss in self-respect has been worth it. Speak to those close to the decision-making, and the refrain is that “no one is being naive here”. Instead, the plea is pragmatism. Three specific claims can be discerned. First, since talk is cheap, why not flatter Trump? Second, what’s been achieved is better than the alternatives (kneecapping Ukraine’s defence and outright trade war). With luck, EU companies may even benefit from the still-higher tariffs put on much non-European trade. And third, policymakers will admitsotto vocethat many of Europe’s pledges to Trump are just for show. Pledges of 5 per cent defence spending and huge investment and purchasing sprees in the US aren’t realistic or intended to be kept but dumb Trump bought them, so well done us. That this stance is unprincipled is incontestable; a principled response would be to fight back. The bigger problem is that it fails proponents’ own test of pragmatism. True pragmatism would be to reduce exposure to a hostile US. What advocates call pragmatism is in fact opportunism — which is not only unsavoury but is also causing real damage, not least to Europe’s own politics. As Trump understands so well, talk is not in fact cheap. Political talk sets expectations and shapes power. Mark Rutte’s and Ursula von der Leyen’s ingratiation with Trump matters, because it means foreign leaders now freely grant him what he has already imposed at home: the acceptance that achieving anything requires not speaking the truth. European leaders have also endorsed Trump’s conception of politics as TV performance. As a result, his tantrums, bullying and craving for ritual subjugation are being normalised on the international stage. Further, Europe has sacrificed the ability to call out his violation of international treaties — such as the World Trade Organization’s requirement of the most-favoured nation principle. It has also fallen in with the idea that results are achieved through personalised bargaining between great men (and occasionally women), rather than the painstaking work of democratic deliberation and consensus building. But note what these choices have cost Europe. It has shed all the political capital it could have mobilised to lead a coalition of countries in defence of rules-based trade and a concerted opposition to Trump. Not only that, it has betrayed its American friends, who had counted on Europe standing up to Trump while they struggled to do so themselves. Most importantly, Europe is risking its political soul. It has put itself in a situation in which leaders cannot say publicly what they are actually trying to do. That is a recipe for distrust and a poison for democracy — and European liberal democracy in particular. How can voters endorse policies whose true nature cannot be admitted publicly (such as the promises to Trump not being real)? If the EU hypocritically accepts what economist Richard Baldwin terms the “grievance doctrine” of globalisation, how can it repel anti-European forces thriving on those views at home? The danger, then, is that European Trump-whispering subordinates the need for broad accountability to a Trumpian “trust the leader” focus on dealmaking, and the inherent authoritarianism this entails. By letting Trump’s will triumph over reality, European leaders’ supposedly pragmatic defence of their own collective interests is in fact accelerating the Trumpification of politics across the continent. Another course was possible. In February, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held his own when berated by Trump in the Oval Office — and is no worse off for it, to judge from his return visit last week.

KDP," Oliver BarnesandJames Fontanella-Khanin New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 UpdatedAugust 25 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Keurig Dr Pepper said on Monday it would acquire European coffee company JDE Peet’s for roughly €16bn, in a deal that sets the stage for a break-up of the US drinks group. The deal will lead to a separation of the combined group’s coffee and soft drinks units, dismantling a 2018 merger that brought Keurig and Dr Pepper together, according to a statement. Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet’s shareholders €31.85 per share in cash, valuing the company’s equity at €15.7bn. JDE Peet’s owns more than 50 brands, including café chain Peet’s Coffee and retail coffee brands Douwe Egberts and Kenco. Shares of Amsterdam-listed JDE Peet’s had closed at €26.50 on Friday before the takeover announcement. Keurig Dr Pepper had a market value of $47bn. Following the takeover, the combined group would be split into two independent US-listed companies focused separately on beverages and coffee. The beverage group represents more than $11bn of annual net sales, while the coffee unit spin-off accounts for $16bn of yearly sales. The deal would create “two winning companies, including a new global coffee champion”, said chief executive Tim Cofer. European investment groupJAB Holdingis a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet’s and still retains a large minority stake in Keurig Dr Pepper, despite selling shares following the 2018 merger. The deal comes as JAB overhauls its investment strategy to focus on insurance afteraggressive dealmakingin the consumer sector. The deal “delivers more than $12.5bn in cash proceeds, creating a rock-solid balance sheet that ideally positions JAB to pursue strategic opportunities”, the group said. Recommended JAB will remain a “meaningful shareholder”, with close to a 5 per cent stake in both the coffee and beverage groups. Keurig Dr Pepper’s soft drinks brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Snapple, have performed well since the 2018 merger, but its coffee division has struggled in the face of stiff competition. Keurig said in July that the performance of its coffee maker would remain “subdued”. Its machines are more expensive to produce due to costs linked to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Keurig Dr Pepper has more recently focused its acquisition strategy on partnerships with fast-growing drinks brands, such as its nearly $1bn deal last year to take a 60 per cent stake in energy drink Ghost.",0.061099998652935,35.13,35.13,0.0,HOLD
NWSA,"This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. BitcoinBTC$115,244.11has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average(GMMA)indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages(white band)below the longer-term averages(red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news – such as Powell’s speech – but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Ether(ETH)printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum. It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20.

TGT,"Shares in wind farm developer Orsted lost ground on Monday.The U.S. government last week ordered the company to halt construction of an almost completed project. Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled soon as trading kicked off on Monday after the U.S. government ordered the company to halt construction of a nearly completed project.By mid-morning, the company's shares were around 17% lower, with shares hitting a record low according to LSEG data.Late on Friday the U.S.' Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hadissueda stop-work order for the Revolution Wind Project off of Rhode Island. According to Orsted, the project is 80% complete and 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.The company alsosaidthat it would comply with the U.S. order and that it was considering options to resolve the issue and press ahead with construction.The order comes at a critical time for Orsted, which is seeking to raise much-needed capital under plans that analysts suggested were now under pressure.Orsted had announcedplansfor a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue earlier this month. On Monday,the company saidit would continue with the proposal, noting that it had the support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.Shares have pulled back sharply since the rights issue plans were announced.In a Monday note, Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank, said the potential financial consequences of the U.S.' order had led to uncertainty about whether Orsted would be able to continue with its capital raising plans.""The financial consequences of the stop-work order will at best be the ongoing costs of the work being stopped,"" he said, according to a Google translation. In the worst-case scenario, the Revolution Wind Project would never supply electricity to the U.S., he added.""In that case, Orsted faces a double-digit billion write-down and significant additional costs to get out of contracts. This will, by all accounts, increase the capital raising requirement to significantly more than DKK 60 billion,"" Pedersen said.He that the company's Monday announcement to push ahead with its rights issue plans suggested it did not expect the worst-case outcome and was expecting its 60 billion Danish kroner target to be sufficient.""Orsted's assessment of this is positive - but it is no guarantee that it will end up like this,"" Pedersen said.",-0.9398999810218812,99.24,99.24,0.0,SELL
TGT,"BitcoinBTC$115,244.11dropped under $111,000 in a sudden weekend flash crash after a whale offloaded 24,000 BTC, or more than $300 million at current prices, into thin liquidity. The whale sent the full balance to Hyperunite, with 12,000 BTC transferred Sunday alone, as CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That move erased gains from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday and sparked heavy forced selling across the market. The sudden selloff fueled liquidations worth $238 million in bitcoin positions and $216 million in ether(ETH), part of more than $550 million cleared in the past day. BTC prices briefly touched below $111,000 before stabilizing near $112,800 as of Asian morning hours Monday. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. Despite the BTC flush, ether has held firmer, trading at $4,707 — up 9% in the past week. Some analysts say whales and institutions are rotating exposure from bitcoin to ether, betting the pending Fed rate cut could lift Ethereum harder given its smaller market cap. “Ethereum's momentum and relatively small market cap compared to Bitcoin would give it more upside in the scenario that the pending Fed rate cut unleashes more money into the money supply,"" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. ""In the event that this happens, both Ethereum and other altcoins could see a major rally."" SignalPlus’s Augustine Fan agreed, pointing to a structural shift in demand: “ETH treasuries have seen a marked rise in public market cap relative to BTC over the past month, with the BTC/ETH ratio rebounding back to technically interesting levels on the latest rally."" Analysts say the rally isn’t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street’s preferred blockchain. “Ether’s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk over the weekend,as reported. That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts especially across traditional incumbents. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

TGT," Hannah PedoneandAntoine Garain New York andIvan Levingstonin London PublishedAugust 24 2025 Simply sign up to thePrivate equitymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Private equity firms are struggling to raise money despite offering unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash, underscoring a sector-wide contraction that is denting the profitability of the industry. Private equitygroups raised just $592bn in the 12 months to June: their lowest tally for seven years, data from Preqin show. The decline came even as firms offered more discounts such as management fee cuts, “early-bird discounts” for investors who commit quickly to new funds and other incentives. They “are offering a smorgasbord of discounts”, said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added in a report by the firm that PE groups were “facing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts”. The industry’s fundraising has shrunk by nearly a third from its record levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowdown indealmakinghave left firms unable to sell trillions of dollars in ageing investments, causing growing frustration from investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds. Accentuating PE’s challenges are a flurry of newer entrants into the industry in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the market oversaturated. It had left a record number of funds chasing every potential dollar of new investment, consultancy Bain said in June. “There are just too many private equity managers seeking capital out there. I just don’t know how else to say it,” said Masotti. As a result, more groups are offering discounts, such as pledging to return the transaction fees that were once charged to their clients, as well as volume-based discounts and novel terms such as caps on some legal and travel expenses. These types of enticements have reduced net management fees paid to PE groups by about half since the global financial crisis, Bain & Co. found. Industry leaders had hoped for a resurgence in dealmaking this year, with the slowdown rooted in firms’ inability to return cash to its investors. PE groups only returned 11 per cent of the industry’s assets to investors last year, the lowest figure since 2009, Bain calculates. “After three years with a lack of liquidity, the rule book for fundraising has been fundamentally rewritten,” said Richard von Gusovius, global co-head of distribution at the private capital advisory Campbell Lutyens. “The investors really want their money back.” Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Dealmakers had anticipated that, following a post-pandemic slump in deals and fundraising, President Donald Trump’s election combined with deregulation would lead to a revival of activity. “That acceleration hasn't materialised the way we had expected,” said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director at Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm. The challenges facing the private capital industry were exacerbated byTrump’s tariffs, which chilled activity around the end of the first quarter. A Campbell Lutyens survey in April found that 33 per cent of limited partners aimed to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump’s tariffs, while 8 per cent were opting for an all-out pause. In Europe, the sector’s difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that several PE firms are fundraising simultaneously. Advent International was seeking more than $25bn for its new fund, Permira was targeting about €17bn for its latest flagship and Bridgepoint was expected to seek roughly €8bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The people added that BC Partners was seeking €5bn for its latest fund, and that the mid-market focused investment group Inflexion was targeting close to €3bn-€4bn for its new fund. They added that Astorg was expected to target about €4.5bn for its next vehicle. Advent, Permira, Bridgepoint, BC, Astorg and Inflexion all declined to comment. “Right now it’s super crowded in the European market in a way I haven’t seen before,” said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Some firms had postponed their fundraising to this year in the hopes of better conditions, she added. “All the ones with delayed fundraises, which are many, they wanted to go after US elections,” she said. A Raymond James report from July showed that about 1,500 buyout funds are aiming to raise $474bn in new funds. However, advisers warned that some funds would not be able to reach their goals as institutional investors slow their new commitments. “[Investors] are looking at each opportunity with a bit of a kind of cool head,” Joseph at Rede Partners said. “The biggest thing that they’re really looking at is [whether] this manager . . . [is] fit for the future.”",-0.964299976825714,99.24,99.24,0.0,SELL

WELL,"Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Monday that cryptocurrencies can be part of a diversified portfolio. ""Crypto assets have risks surrounding high volatility, but through building an appropriate investment environment, they could be part of diversified investments,"" Kato said while speaking at an event in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The minister added that the government has been trying to ensure that innovation isn't stifled by excessive regulation. Kato's comments are particularly notable in the context of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, which raises concerns about imminent financial repression and potential depreciation of the yen. Financial repression involves policies aimed at reducing government debt burdens through measures such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation and capital controls. These policies tend to erode returns on traditional fixed-income and cash holdings, thereby boosting the appeal of alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies, which offer real returns and diversification.

A depressed prime property market and a new tax-free regime have made buying in London more attractive to wealthy United Arab Emirates residents over the past year, according to their advisers. Property agents and tax lawyers told the Financial Times that purchasers included UAE nationals and long-term UK expats, with some looking to relocate and others wanting a foothold in London at decade-low prices. “The uptick in interest from the Middle East has been quite marked in the last three or four months,” said James Forbes, co-founder of Forbes Gilbert-Green, a London property advisory firm. “There’s an obvious increase in activity. London is looking cheaper than it was.” Prime property in the UK capital has been in a slump over the past decade in part because of higher housing levies, uncertainty over Brexit and non-dom tax changes. House prices in Kensington and Chelseafell to their lowest since 2013in May 2025. In her first Budget last October, chancellor Rachel Reeves abolished non-dom status and initiated a tax regime under which rich foreign arrivals or those returning to the UK after a decade overseas do not pay tax on their foreign income and gains (FIG) for four years. A tax lawyer who specialises in the Middle East said: “I’ve got one British expat client who’s been in Dubai for a long time and he is now moving back to the UK and taking advantage of the new four-year FIG regime.” Reeveswas told by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, to expect 25 per cent of non-doms with trusts to quit the UK in response to the crackdown on their tax status, which began under the previous Conservative government. Stuart Bailey, head of prime central London sales at estate agent Knight Frank, said: “If you are from the UAE, for example, and of a generation that has not yet bought in London, both the suppressed pricing and the four-year FIG regime present a good time to buy.” “Non-doms being pushed out of London certainly doesn’t benefit the wider economy, or the government with reduced stamp duty being collected, but it works well for opportunistic buyers, with less competition all the better,” he added. Property values in Dubai have soared in recent years, with average prices per square foot up 67 per cent since July 2019, according to data analytics group Reidin. Luxury properties have gained particularly quickly, giving some homeowners in the UAE’s biggest city a chance to cash in. UAE nationals accounted for 3 per cent of overseas buyers in prime central London in the year to July, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year, according to Knight Frank, which declined to provide absolute numbers. There are about 1mn Emirati nationals, according to official figures, and prime London sales comprise a small part of the overall residential property market. Liza-Jane Kelly, head of London residential at estate agent Savills, said she had found homes for two returning British expats in the past three months. Both of them wanted UK education for their children, and one cited tax reasons. “One said they’ve been in Dubai for 15 years, and it’s changed, and it’s got a lot busier,” Kelly said. The returnees bought in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, respectively, spending between £4mn and £6.5mn, she said. Becky Fatemi, executive partner at Sotheby’s UK International, said recent changes standardising UAE school holidays made spending family time in the UK easier, with some families looking to split the year between the UAE and Europe. Recommended Despite July and August typically being quiet months, Fatemi said her company had experienced its busiest summer in three years, with buyers taking advantage of the dip in values to snap up sites that historically would not have come to market. Interest in UK property goes beyond homes: Middle East family offices and wealthy individuals have invested £245mn in UK commercial real estate so far this year, compared with just £25mn for all of 2024, according to Knight Frank. Reeves has been told by Treasury officials that fears of a mass non-dom exodus have been overstated and that there are encouraging signs that some wealthy people are deciding to move from Dubai to London. But there is no guarantee new arrivals will settle for the long term. The Treasury said: “The UK remains a highly attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is simpler and more attractive than the previous one.” Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai",-0.935100018978118,164.39,164.39,0.0,SELL

TGT," Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent PublishedAugust 27 2025 UpdatedAugust 27 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world Denmark has summoned the top US diplomat in the country over reports that American citizens with alleged links to President Donald Trump have been conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, said on Wednesday that there were “foreign actors” attempting to influence the future ofGreenlandand that all such efforts were “unacceptable”. He has summoned Mark Stroh, the chargé d’affaires at the US embassy in Copenhagen and its most senior diplomat inDenmarkat present, for a meeting at the foreign ministry. Denmark has been shaken by Trump’s repeated suggestions that the US wants totake control of the vast Arctic island— a semi-autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark — from Copenhagen, and his refusal to rule out using force to do so. The Scandinavian country had already summoned the top US diplomat in May, following a report in the Wall Street Journal that a classified message wassent to American intelligence agenciesurging them to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who support Trump’s ambition to take over the island. The latest report by DR, the Danish public broadcaster, said Danish authorities were aware of at least three US citizens with alleged links to the Trump administration gathering information in Greenland and conducting influence operations. Rasmussen said in television interviews that he was “not surprised” by the report. But he added: “It’s important that we gain some insight into this so that our people — in both Greenland and Denmark — know what it is that we risk being up against.” Denmark’s security and intelligence service (PET) said on Wednesday that its assessment was that “Greenland, especially in the current situation, is the target of influence campaigns of various kinds. PET expects that such campaigns have the purpose of creating a split in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.” Some senior Danish officials sought to downplay the significance of summoning Stroh, saying that the three US citizens appeared to act in an amateur way and there was no link established to US intelligence. Recommended But Danish politicians reacted with dismay. “This means the whole misery over Greenland is not over,” former foreign minister Martin Lidegaard told the TV channel TV2. He added: “This is putting a heavy strain on our relationship with the US — and Americans should know that too.” Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark’s parliament, said: “It is beyond a joke that they try to infiltrate Greenland’s society in this way. It is Greenland itself who must decide what we want and what future we want.” The allegations come just days after the Trump administration caused pain to Danish business by issuing a stop-work order on an almost complete offshore wind farm co-owned by Ørsted. That came on the same day that Rasmussen and Denmark’s ambassador to the US signed a partnership with California’s Governor Gavin Newsom, the self-styled leader of the resistance to Trump. Danish officials deny there is a connection between the two events. The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The US is currently without an ambassador in Copenhagen despite Trump naming Ken Howery, who is close to Elon Musk, in December. In a separate move, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Wednesday apologised to the thousands of Greenlandic women who over decades were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils. She acknowledged that the case had caused “anger and sorrow” in Greenland as well as hurting perceptions of Denmark. “We cannot change what has happened. But we can take responsibility. Therefore, on behalf of Denmark, I would like to say: sorry.” Many Greenlanders use this issue to express why they want to gain independence from Denmark, but surveys suggest the 57,000 on the Arctic island are reluctant to do so imminently for fear of losing out economically.",-0.87389999628067,96.11,96.11,0.0,SELL
