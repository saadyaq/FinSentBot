Shares in the electric vehicle maker fell 8 per cent on Thursday, extending their loss to 37 per cent from a peak in mid-December, a fall that has now wiped more than half a trillion dollars from its market value. On Wednesday evening Tesla reported that second-quarter profitdeclinedmore than a fifth on slowing car sales. Musk said that Trump’s trade war and anti-EV and solar power policies would further hit the company’s earnings. “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US,” Musk said on Wednesday. “We probably could have a few rough quarters.” Trump’s tax and spend actputs at riskthe billions of dollars in annual profit that Tesla makes from selling regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The legislation also ends a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that has helped drive sales. Trump denied he was retaliating against Musk after their acrimonious political split, posting on Truth Social that he wanted “all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!” “Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government,” the president said. “This is not so!” Musk bankrolled Trump’s campaign with more than $250mn last year and after the election spearheaded the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). His close relationship with Trump was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla but ended up alienating many left-leaning customers. After a tumultuous four months marked by clashes with Trump’s cabinet, the world’s richest man emerged as a leading critic of the administration’s economic and trade policies, vowed to launch his own party and helped reignite speculation about the president’s relationship with the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump in turn has suggested that the US government should turn Doge on Musk’s empire, cancelling lucrative contracts for his companies that include SpaceX, its satellite broadband network Starlink and xAI. Tesla’s adjusted net income fell to about $1.4bn for the second quarter, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn the previous year. Revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.7bn and its operating margin narrowed. “There was no attempt to sugar coat the market headwinds for EVs,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, adding that Tesla had to “cross the chasm” to the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, “while absorbing slower volume, EV incentive elimination, tariffs and investing in new initiatives that may not make margins for years”. Musk has tried to convince investors that the company’s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service. He also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. Musk also renewed his threat to leave Tesla if he is not given more shares, after a Delaware judge struck down a pay package that would have been the largest in US history. If reinstated on appeal by Delaware’s Supreme Court, the package would increase Musk’s ownership of Tesla from just under 13 per cent to more than 20 per cent. “That is a major concern for me . . . I’ve got so little control that I can easily be ousted by activist shareholders after having built this army of humanoid robots,” Musk said “I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”",-0.96560001373291,306.15,306.89,0.0024171157929120013,HOLD

Tesla has warned of a further hit to revenue from Donald Trump’s trade war and anti-electric vehicle policies in the US president’s “big, beautiful bill”, darkening the outlook as second-quarter profits fell by more than a fifth. Trump’s signature fiscal legislation puts at risk a crucial source of profit for Tesla that had allowed the electric-vehicle maker to sell billions of dollars of regulatory credits to more polluting rivals to offset their emissions. The hit to Tesla from the president’s policies — including the loss of EV and solar power incentives — has deepened chief executiveElon Musk’s rift with Trump, pulling the world’s richest man back into politics despite his promise to investors to refocus his attention on the electric-car maker. “We are in the transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,” Musk said. “We probably could have a few rough quarters.” Teslashares fell 8 per cent in early trading on Thursday following Musk’s comments.

A consumer backlash against Musk’s political activities has contributed to a sales slump at Tesla, which is also suffering from an ageing model line-up and greater EV competition from Chinese and western rivals. The Austin, Texas-based company on Wednesday reported that its adjusted net income came in close to analysts’ expectations at $1.4bn for the three months through June, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn a year earlier. The carmaker warned Trump’s policies would add to its difficulties in the coming months. Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla had a limited supply of vehicles and might not be able to deliver enough cars in time to meet orders if consumers rushed to beat the September deadline for the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases and leases. Teslastands to losemuch of the income from the sale of its regulatory credits after Trump’s bill eliminated fines for non-compliance, throwing the future of emissions trading programmes in doubt. Revenue from the credits almost halved to $439mn in the quarter from a year before. Last year, the company made $2.8bn from these sales. The bill also threatens Tesla’s other business lines by removing a range of incentives for renewable energy. Taneja said Tesla faced $300mn in additional tariff-related costs in the second quarter and warned this figure would increase through the year. The US has imposed higher tariffs on foreign-sourced cars and components, including battery cells that Tesla imports from China. “While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front,” he added. In an attempt to revive its sales momentum, the company said it would aim to begin mass production of its delayed affordable model during the second half of the year. Recommended Tesla’s revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.5bn in the second quarter from a year earlier, close to the average $22.7bn analyst estimate, according to data from Visible Alpha. Its operating margin dropped to 4.1 per cent, from 6.3 per cent. Reported net income declined 16 per cent to $1.2bn. With the slide in its automotive revenue, Musk has tried to convince investors that the company’s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service, which launched in Austin last month. Musk said the number of robotaxis in operation would increase at “a hyper-exponential rate”, making the ride-hailing service available to half of the US population by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.

ADP," Stefania PalmaandLauren Fedorin Washington PublishedJuly 24 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world A US federal judge has rejected the Trump administration’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts linked to Jeffrey Epstein, as the White House battles to contain the fallout over files linked to the late paedophile financier. District judge Robin Rosenberg on Wednesday argued that district courts did not have the power to release the records except in rare circumstances, and said the government’s request was “not based on any of the exceptions” to a federal rule governing the secrecy of grand jury files. The decision by the Florida judge came after Trump last week directed US attorney-general Pam Bondito unseal grand jury transcriptslinked to the financier, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The administration has faced weeks of mounting pressure over the Epstein case, which hasexposed fissuresin the president’s Maga movement after he reneged on a campaign promise to make public files relating to the disgraced financier. A memo published by the justice department and FBI this month said there was “no credible evidence” that Epstein “blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions” and that a “client list” did not exist. That sparked outrage from some of the loudest voices in the Maga movement, many of whom called for Bondi to resign.Trumphas stood by his attorney-general. But the president faced fresh questions about his links to Epstein on Wednesday, when US media reported that Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche informed Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. Earlier this month, the president was asked by a reporter at the White House whether Bondi had told him that his name appeared in the files. He replied: “No, she has given us just a very quick briefing, and in terms of the credibility of the different things that they have seen.” Trump has previously said he was Epstein’s friend for 15 years, but claimed the two had a falling out more than 20 years ago.

A," Christopher Millerin Kyiv PublishedJuly 24 2025 UpdatedJuly 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to soften his stance on bringing the country’s anti-corruption bodies under executive control on Thursday, approving a new bill that he said would guarantee the agencies’ independence after taking advice from the UK prime minister.Zelenskyy said the bill would be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament. He said earlier he had discussed the legislation with British premier Sir Keir Starmer, who “suggested involving experts who could contribute to long-term co-operation on anti-corruption initiatives’’.Zelenskyy’s statement and his call with Starmer came after the Ukrainian leader’s push to subordinate the agencies to his handpicked prosecutor-general sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion. The move was condemned by the EU and G7 members, while critics accused Zelenskyy of an authoritarian power grab.It remains unclear how far the new bill will go towards restoring full independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (Sapo).Ukrainians’ frustration with the president has boiled over amid a deepening political crisis of his own making. Protests in Kyiv on Wednesday involved roughly 10,000 demonstrators — more than triple the previous day — who shouted “shame” and demanded that Zelenskyy “veto the law”. Thousands more turned out in other cities including Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa. “Everyone has heard what people are saying,’’ Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday night address to the nation, seeking to assuage public concern. ‘‘It’s not falling on deaf ears.”Yaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition MP who was among those who voted against the law, said on Thursday that he and 47 other lawmakers had submitted a draft law to revoke the amendments embedded in the earlier one that limited the powers of Nabu and Sapo. The president said his push to put the prosecutor-general, whom he appointed, in charge of Nabu and Sapo was aimed at rooting out Russian spies.The protests against the decision have been some of the biggest since the 2014 Euromaidan uprising that set Ukraine on a western course. Soldiers said they had been ordered by military leaders to avoid attending the protests and to refrain from posting criticism on social media. But many still came out in uniform to protest in Kyiv. One veteran and double-amputee at a rally near the president’s office held a sign that read: “We are fighting for Ukraine, not your impunity.” The criticism of Zelenskyy has been scathing, marking an unprecedented shift in Ukraine’s wartime discourse. Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, many Ukrainians had largely refrained from public dissent to prioritise national unity, but that consensus is now showing signs of strain.Critics said the original law, rushed through parliament with unusual speed and secrecy, resembled infamous “dictatorship laws” from 2014 that gave pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych extraordinary powers. Nabu and Sapo welcomed Zelenskyy’s revised version of the bill and said it restored “all procedural powers and guarantees of the independence of Nabu and Sapo”. They said in a statement: “Nabu and Sapo participated in the preparation of the text and urge the Verkhovna Rada to adopt the president’s initiative as a basis and in full as soon as possible. This will help prevent threats to criminal proceedings investigated by Nabu and Sapo.”In Washington, before Zelenskyy’s latest concessions, Democrat senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican senator Lindsey Graham published a statement on Wednesday praising the “enormous strides” Ukraine had made on anti-corruption since 2014 despite Russia’s aggression. But they added, “we fear [the new law] undermines much of that progress’’. The situation has unfolded as Russian forces gain territory in Ukraine at their fastest pace in more than a year and the air war escalates. Russian drone strikes overnight in the historic centre of Odesa injured at least four people, according to regional governor Oleh Kiper. The attack came hours after a third round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul ended without significant progress towards ending the war. The Kremlin on Thursday said it did not see how Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy could meet before the end of August. Zelenskyy has said the issues central to ending the largest armed conflict on European soil in generations could only be settled in a face-to-face meeting between himself and Putin.

ADP," Christopher Millerin Kyiv PublishedJuly 24 2025 UpdatedJuly 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to soften his stance on bringing the country’s anti-corruption bodies under executive control on Thursday, approving a new bill that he said would guarantee the agencies’ independence after taking advice from the UK prime minister.Zelenskyy said the bill would be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament. He said earlier he had discussed the legislation with British premier Sir Keir Starmer, who “suggested involving experts who could contribute to long-term co-operation on anti-corruption initiatives’’.Zelenskyy’s statement and his call with Starmer came after the Ukrainian leader’s push to subordinate the agencies to his handpicked prosecutor-general sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion. The move was condemned by the EU and G7 members, while critics accused Zelenskyy of an authoritarian power grab.It remains unclear how far the new bill will go towards restoring full independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (Sapo).Ukrainians’ frustration with the president has boiled over amid a deepening political crisis of his own making. Protests in Kyiv on Wednesday involved roughly 10,000 demonstrators — more than triple the previous day — who shouted “shame” and demanded that Zelenskyy “veto the law”.

On Thursday, the Community Notes X accountannouncedthe launch of a pilot test where select contributors would be able to rate posts by answering questions about why they either like or don’t like that particular post. The system is similar to how Community Notes fact-checking works. Instead of simply allowing users to upvote or downvote posts for accuracy — something that could be easily gamed if like-minded contributors teamed up to promote their own views — Community Notes uses something called a “bridging algorithm.” This attempts to find consensus among people who don’t usually share the same views. If users whose opinions typically differ both agree that a fact-check is accurate, the note is published and made visible to the public. While X’s system has been criticized for being too slow and unable to keep up with the massive amounts of misinformation that circulate on the platform, this same idea has sincebeen adopted by Metaas a replacement for fact-checking. Now X intends to see if Community Notes could help identify the best posts, too. Starting today, the company says that a subset of Community Notes contributors will begin seeing a new callout in the product when a post is gaining attention in the form of Likes. Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives.

For about six months, Thorpe was a prolific volunteer contributor to an open source project led by database companyTurso. His work was impressive enough that Turso’s CEO,Glauber Costa, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer. “I checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,” Costa told TechCrunch. “It’s a story I’ve never seen before.”It’s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he hasworked full-timefrom his cell at a venture-funded, San Francisco-based startup since May. “I reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,” Costa said. “Since then, I’ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today …Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.” Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative. Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later. “I was a complete idiot,” Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. “I had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.” Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew. “When I came to Maine, it was completely different,” he reminisced. “COVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance — there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it’s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: ‘I’m going to make something of myself.’” At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe enrolled remotely at the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk. “After consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it’s been very successful,” Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. “His students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.” Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support. “Maine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,” Haley Shoaf, co-executive director ofUnlocked Labs, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons. “[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,” Shoaf said. Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift. “When I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,” Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. “I began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.” While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison — the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child — Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like. “I have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,” Commissioner Liberty said. “When they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, ‘If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.’” The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners’ return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it’s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment. “It’s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?” Commissioner Liberty said. “Many states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% — you don’t come back at all.” Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum-security prison in Maine saw only seven assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017. “When you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,” Shoaf said. Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty’s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man. “It’s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,” Thorpe said. “All the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn’t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.” Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming. “He was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,” Costa said. In the open source community, where developers often can’t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself — a Linux-obsessed engineer who’s interested in relational databases — and not as a criminal. “The worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],” Thorpe said. “Letting someone have a career gives you purpose.”  Topics Senior Writer Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

AES,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Apple released the firstpublic betaof its new mobile operating system, iOS 26, featuring its “Liquid Glass” user interface and improved AI features. The release allows early adopters to get their hands on Apple’s latest software before its wider public availability later this fall. The update represents the most notable visual transformation since iOS 7,featuring a “Liquid Glass” designthat offers a more transparent, glass-like feel to user interface elements, like buttons, screens, and in-app navigation and controls, among other things. Liquid Glass is integrated throughout iOS 26, including in key apps like Phone, Camera, Safari, Music, and others, as well as in notifications, theLock Screen, Control Center, and the Home Screen. The software update also includes an redesigned Lock Screen for iPhone and iPad with a 3D photo effect and dynamic clock and updated app icons, which users can now set to clear, too. In terms ofAI features, the new software brings alive translation featurethat translates conversations in real time, AI-powered shortcuts,poll suggestions in Messages, and an update to Visual Intelligence for conducting image searches as you browse. Other software versions, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26, have also adopted the Liquid Glass design. Here is a brief overview of all the new features being introduced. In addition to the glass aesthetic, iPhone users have several updates to be excited about, including adedicated gaming appthat serves as a new destination for playing and discovering games in one place. The Phone app is introducing a new Call Screening feature that prompts unknown callers to state their name and reason for calling before the recipient answers. Additionally, a Hold Assist feature will notify users when hold music ends, signaling that they can speak to a live agent. The app, along with Messages and FaceTime, will also support real-time live translations. In the Messages app, meanwhile, users can expect a feature that has AI-generated suggestions for polls. In addition, iOS 26 will bring updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, as well asimprovementsto Camera, Photos, Maps,and a range of other minor additions, including the ability to customize alarm snooze times. A big win for iPad users is that they’ll experience a moreMac-like tablet. For example, iPadOS 16 is bringing the Preview app from macOS, which enables annotation on PDFs. Plus, a new windowing system that lets users adjust the size of web pages and apps, as well as manage multiple windows and tabs at once. One notable update formacOS 26involves Spotlight, which will employ AI to anticipate user searches and suggest actions based on frequently performed tasks or ongoing projects. Additionally, macOS is gaining Live Activities, allowing users to sync activities directly with their iPhones and access recent calls and contacts. One of the more significant features coming to the newwatchOSis Workout Buddy, a fitness assistant powered by Apple Intelligence that provides motivation using a generative AI voice during workouts, pointing out key moments like closing the Exercise ring for the day. Apple has also revamped the Workout app, introducing a helpful new option called Autoplay Media. This feature automatically starts playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Additionally, Apple Music can intelligently recommend the most suitable playlists for your workouts and will recall listening habits for each type of exercise. Another update is the automatic volume adjustment capability, which adjusts the volume of calls, timers, alarms, and Siri to match the surrounding sound levels, ideal for quiet places like libraries. Apple also introduced a new one-handed flick gesture that’s designed to dismiss notifications, silence incoming calls, and return to the watch face, among other actions.

The release allows early adopters to get their hands on Apple’s latest software before its wider public availability later this fall. The update represents the most notable visual transformation since iOS 7,featuring a “Liquid Glass” designthat offers a more transparent, glass-like feel to user interface elements, like buttons, screens, and in-app navigation and controls, among other things. Liquid Glass is integrated throughout iOS 26, including in key apps like Phone, Camera, Safari, Music, and others, as well as in notifications, theLock Screen, Control Center, and the Home Screen. The software update also includes an redesigned Lock Screen for iPhone and iPad with a 3D photo effect and dynamic clock and updated app icons, which users can now set to clear, too. In terms ofAI features, the new software brings alive translation featurethat translates conversations in real time, AI-powered shortcuts,poll suggestions in Messages, and an update to Visual Intelligence for conducting image searches as you browse. Other software versions, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26, have also adopted the Liquid Glass design. Here is a brief overview of all the new features being introduced. In addition to the glass aesthetic, iPhone users have several updates to be excited about, including adedicated gaming appthat serves as a new destination for playing and discovering games in one place. The Phone app is introducing a new Call Screening feature that prompts unknown callers to state their name and reason for calling before the recipient answers. Additionally, a Hold Assist feature will notify users when hold music ends, signaling that they can speak to a live agent. The app, along with Messages and FaceTime, will also support real-time live translations. In the Messages app, meanwhile, users can expect a feature that has AI-generated suggestions for polls. In addition, iOS 26 will bring updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, as well asimprovementsto Camera, Photos, Maps,and a range of other minor additions, including the ability to customize alarm snooze times. A big win for iPad users is that they’ll experience a moreMac-like tablet. For example, iPadOS 16 is bringing the Preview app from macOS, which enables annotation on PDFs. Plus, a new windowing system that lets users adjust the size of web pages and apps, as well as manage multiple windows and tabs at once. One notable update formacOS 26involves Spotlight, which will employ AI to anticipate user searches and suggest actions based on frequently performed tasks or ongoing projects. Additionally, macOS is gaining Live Activities, allowing users to sync activities directly with their iPhones and access recent calls and contacts. One of the more significant features coming to the newwatchOSis Workout Buddy, a fitness assistant powered by Apple Intelligence that provides motivation using a generative AI voice during workouts, pointing out key moments like closing the Exercise ring for the day. Apple has also revamped the Workout app, introducing a helpful new option called Autoplay Media. This feature automatically starts playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Additionally, Apple Music can intelligently recommend the most suitable playlists for your workouts and will recall listening habits for each type of exercise. Another update is the automatic volume adjustment capability, which adjusts the volume of calls, timers, alarms, and Siri to match the surrounding sound levels, ideal for quiet places like libraries. Apple also introduced a new one-handed flick gesture that’s designed to dismiss notifications, silence incoming calls, and return to the watch face, among other actions.

Today, more than 20% of daters report using AI for things like crafting dating profiles or sparking conversations, per a recentMatch.com study. Some are taking it further by forming emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with AI companions. Millions of people around the world are using AI companions from companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI, including72% of U.S. teens. Some people have reportedfalling in love with more general LLMs like ChatGPT. For some, the trend of dating bots is dystopian and unhealthy, a real-life version of the movie “Her” and a signal that authentic love is being replaced by a tech company’s code. For others, AI companions are a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy is increasingly hard to find. A recent study found thata quarter of young adultsthink AI relationships could soon replace human ones altogether. Love, it seems, is no longer strictly human. The question is: Should it be? Or can dating an AI be better than dating a human? That was the topic of discussion last month at an event I attended in New York City, hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. TechCrunch was given exclusive access to publish the full video (which includes me asking the debaters a question, because I’m a reporter, and I can’t help myself!). Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the “On with Kara Swisher” podcast and is the current host of “Smart Girl Dumb Questions.” Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that “AI is an exciting new form of connection … Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.” Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He’s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled “The Intimate Animal.” You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments. Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can’t get in their human relationships. “AI listens to you without its ego,” Ha said. “It adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.” She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to “your fallible ex or maybe your current partner.” “The one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, ‘I’m listening,’ without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,” she said. “When was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?” Ha conceded that since AI doesn’t have a consciousness, she isn’t claiming that “AI can authentically love us.” That doesn’t mean people don’t have theexperienceof being loved by AI. Garcia countered that it’s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that’s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That’s not “an honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,” he argued. “This idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don’t think so.” Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. “I think if we’re using it as a tool to build skills, yes … that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,” Garcia said. “The idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.” According to a Match.comSingles in America study, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI. “Now I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha’s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,” he said. “On the other hand, it goes to my point, that they’re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn’t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.” Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don’t trust AI. “According to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,” Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGov poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions. “A little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don’t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,” Garcia said. “We cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don’t trust.” Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships. “They are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,” Ha said. “I think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.” AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through. But it’s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we’re in, many people have been feeling “touch starvation” — a condition that happens when you don’t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone. Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits. “The potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,” Ha said. “The tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.” Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors — especially if that’s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI. That concern is not unfounded.Multiple studieshave shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, aremore likely to be sexually aggressivewith real-life partners. “Work by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,” Garcia said. He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners. “We have enough of that in society,” he said. Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design. Of course, she made that comment before the White House released itsAI Action Plan, which says nothing about transparency — which many frontier AI companies are against — or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.
